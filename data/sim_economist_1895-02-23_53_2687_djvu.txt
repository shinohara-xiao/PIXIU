SCOTTISH PROVIDENT 
INSTITUTION. 


MUTUAL ASSURANCE. MODERATE PREMIUMS 

THE PREMIUMS are so moderate that, at usual ages for Assurance 
£1,200 or £1,250 may be secured from the first for the Yearly Payment 
which in most Offices would be charged (with Profits) for £1,000 only— 
equivalent to an immediate and certain Bonus of 20 to 25 per cent. 

THE WHOLE SURPLUS goes to the Policyholders on a system at 
once safe and equitable—no Share going to those by whose early death 
there is a Loss to the Common Fund. 


THE DISTINCTIVE SYSTEM of the Institution is specially suit- 
able for Assurances effected for the purpose of providing a Fund for the 


payment of the 
Death Duties 
recently imposed. The Premiums, with right to participate in the 


Surplus, differ little from the non-profit rates of other Offices ; never 
theless,as the result of persistent economy and prudent manageme nt, 
the Bonus additions under Policies becoming claims have averaged for 
many years 50 percent. on the Assurances which participated.

THE MONEY MARKET. 

It is now just a year since the Bank reduced its rate 
to 2 per cent., and a comparison between its position 
now and then is of interest. Its stock of bullion, which 
twelve months ago stood at £29,750,000, now amounts 
to £37,502,000, thus showing an increase of about 
£7,750,000. Similarly its reserve has risen from 
£22,602,000 to £29,673,000, and although in the interval 
its liabilities have also been increased, “the proportion of 
reserve to liabilities, which a year back was 60} per cent., 
is now no less than 703 per cent. In all respects, there- 
fore, the Bank is in a much stronger position at present 
than it was when the 2 per cent minimum was established, 
and it would remain stronger even if it were called upon 
to furnish two or three millions of gold for export to the 
United States. It cannot be said, therefore, that there 
is any near prospect of an advance in the official rate, but 
the temporary tying up of money in connection with the 
applications for the new United States loan, and the 
preparations for the payment of railway dividends, together 
with the drain of the revenue collection have this week 
caused a reduction of market supplies, and the | 
for best three months’ bills has risen to 1,4, per cent. 

is not likely, however, that this advance will be iully 
maintained when the funds which have been momentarily 
displaced are again rendered available. Meanwhile, the 
discount houses have raised their allowance on deposits 
at notice to # per cent., their rate for money at call 
remaining at 4 per cent.

with its own consent, so that Mr. Bryce practically says : 
‘“‘T will do what I cannot do” rather than lose votes. 
Asa matter of fact, of course he will make inquiries, 
will find that the birthplace of brushes cannot be dis- 
cerned by any study, however prolonged, of their 
handles or bristles, and will give no orders, trusting 
that the House will either forget the whole matter, 
or, if it remembers it, will attribute negligence to 
the Preventive service, and not to the Board of Trade. 





THE WEAKNESS OF THE GOVERNMENT. 


We do not care particularly for any party reason whether 
the dissolution arrives at once or towards the end of 
the Session, or even in the beginning of next year. 
A Government with a majority of fourteen cannot do 
much active mischief; none of the dangerous Bills will 
pass, and among electors, time is very rarely in favour of 
a decaying party. The masses weary of feebleness in 
their rulers sooner than of anything. If tke country is 
not convinced now that Lord Rosebery has failed, it will 
not be convinced by August, and if it is convinced, its 
conviction will by August have been deepened and 
strengthened so that a delayed election may give to both 
parties a more definite response. But we do care that 
the country should be strongly governed, by men who 
are acting on fixed convictions, and it is not and cannot 
be so governed now. The Government has a large and 
tolerably firm party behind it, but the Opposition is so 
nearly equal to it, and the temper of the mass 
of electors is so doubtful, that the Cabinet might 
be overthrown by the secession of ten men. It 
is, therefore, obliged to consult even individual 
fancies, it is afraid of alienating the smallest 
group, and it is compelled, every day almost, to make

correspondents to mark their brushes falsely, and there 
the matter will end. 
The situation as regards the brush trade is only absurd, 
but the weakness of the Government is very serious. 
There is no knowing what it may accept if only a refusal 
would cost it a few votes. The sugar refiners, for ex- 
ample, are much more unfortunate people than the brush 
makers, and the bounties given to sugar makers by many 
foreign Governments are nearly as unfair to British 
refiners as their use of convict labour ; but is the Govern- 
ment suddenly in a debate raised by a private member to 
agree to prohibit all sugar imported from countries giving 
bounties? The dependence of the Cabinet on a few 
votes, and on the coherence of many petty little groups, 
é j i takes all the nerve out of its representatives, until 
concessions which are, in fact, confessions that} we find men like Mr Bryce, who as a rule quite 
it cannot fulfil the ordinary duties of its position. Take, | understand what they are saying, actually agreeing to do 
as a singularly clear example, the debate on Tuesday} what they know, and say they know, is physically 
night. Colonel Howard Vincent, who makes himself the | impossible. It is quite true that some of the blame must

undersold. He, therefore, moved a resolution that | Opposition would never have been tempted to give the

the importation of goods made in foreign prisons. The} which suffers from such exhibitions, but Government 
complaint is reasonable enough, if not for Col. Vincent's | itself, which is revealed in the face of the whole world as 
reasons, then for another one. We have, after reflection, vacillating and powerless. There ceases, in fact, to be

which, though they seem big, are in reality unessential 
and fugitive. Other English communities, when they 
get into astate of excitement and unrest, are able to 
relieve themselves by blowing off their steam in a 
delibevative assembly of some kind or other, or in 
the columns of the local Press. Such opportunities 
are practically denied to the English in Egypt, and 
hence the risk that the telegraph wires and the 
hospitable columns of the Zimes will be used as a kind 
of safety-valve. We have not the remotest intention 
of accusing the able officials who represent England in 
Egypt of being in any sense sensation-mongers, or of 
themselves encouraging wild talk. Such wild talk, 
however, easily springs up in Cairo, and is as easily 
telegraphed to London. We lately saw an example of 
this in regard to the Egyptian finances. Grave doubts were 
expressed in the Egyptian telegrams as to the financial 
situation, and a great deal of strong writing was indulged 
in. Yet it turned out that in reality nothing could be 
more satisfactory than the state of the Hgyptian 
Treasury, and that the country is in possession of a 
handsome surplus. 

But though we do not think it would be wise to make 
too much of the Khedive’s restlessness and the resulting 
unsettlement in the Departments of State, or, again, to 
attribute any definite and serious intention to the French 
authorities of helping the Khedive to try and get rid of 
‘‘the Occupation’’ by a sudden coup, we are quite 
aware that the French are at this moment giving 
as much trouble as possible at Cairo. We have 
little doubt that at the present moment the more 
violent and foolish section of the French colony is 
working specially hard and pertinaciously to injure us 
in Egypt, and to inspire the natives with the belief that 
we cannot remain much longer on the Nile, and that it 
is, therefore, not only safe, but even advisable, to work 
against England and to support her enemies The 
policy of worry, exaggeration, and countermining 
practised by the French in Egypt is, we are quite ready 
to admit, a subject not capable of exaggeration. One 
has only to read the venomous rubbish which flows each 
day out of the office of the Journal Egypltien to realise 
what is the spirit which inspires the I'rench colony. 
Nor is this spirit without its reflection in Paris. 
The colonial group in the French Chamber lends 
a ready support to the most violent and heady of 
the attacks levelled against the Englishmen who are 
so ably controlling the administration of Egypt, 
and even forces the Foreign Office to countenance 
through its representatives in Cairo the campaign 
of scurrility, misrepresentation, and intrigue which it is 
fondly imagined will destroy English influence, and 
render the task of English government in Egypt impos- 
sible. The able French diplomats on the spot would, 
doubtless, be only too glad to snub and discourage the 
plan of action which is advocated by the Journal Egyp- 
tien. So strong, however, is the pressure brought to bear on 
them via Paris, that they are liable to be dragged, though 
reluctantly and with disgust, at the heels of any frenzied 
paragraph writer or café quidnunc who wishes to demon- 
strate his loathing of the perfidious English. The desire 
of the French Government and people to do us as much 
harm as possible in Egypt, and their liability to act in 
the most violent and angry way possible, is a fact which 
cannot possibly be ignored. 

The persistency of Irench ill-feeling and of French 
efforts to injure us in Egypt is, as we have said, a fact, 
but it is alsoa fact that by adopting a policy of open 
hostility, the French are doing the very thing which is 
most likely to keepus on the Nile. It is their frenzied 
opormon to everything English, and to all our efforts to 
administer Egypt wisely and well, which makes evacua- 
tion impossible. One hardly understands how it is that 
the French do not see that this must beso. Let them 
consider whether they could be induced to abandon the 
occupation of the Regency of Tunis by constant attacks 
in the Italian Press, by violent accusations of ill-faith 
and hypocrisy, and by an organised movement among the 
Italian colony in Tunis for making French government 
impossible within the dominions of the Bey. Would not 

‘the French, in effect, reply to such tactics, ‘ This, 











THE ECONOMIST. 251 





at any rate, is not the way to make us evacuate 
Tunis?” So with England. As long as the French talk 
wildly about kicking us out of Egypt, and make believe 
to do so, we are bound to stay. What Minister, under 
present circumstances, would dare to evacuate Egypt ? 
He would be covered with a storm of obloquy‘as the man 
who had allowed France ‘‘ to kick us out.” Again, how 
can the French plan of stimulating native feeling against 
us possibly assist the policy of evacuation? Does any 
reasonable I’renchman suppose that a rising in Alexandria 
or an outbreak of Mahommedan ili-feeling in Egypt 
generally, would help on the realisation of what France 
desires? Would not such events instead remove evacua- 
tion at once from the sphere of practical politics? We 
wonder that Frenchmen do not sce that what would be 
most likely to lead to evacuation would be five years 
of calm water in Egypt. If for five years France 
did nothing whatever to injure us in LlJgypt, 
and if during that time the country sank into 
that condition of peace and quiet which is natural 
to it, the prospects of evacuation would be infinitely 
brighter than they are just now. The continuance of 
French hostility has killed the party of evacuation in 
England. If France were to give up her present course 
of action that party would revive, and after a few years 
of quiet in Egypt would be stronger than it ever was. 
Acting in conjunction with a moderate and courteous 
reminder of our pledges from France it would very 
possibly carry the day. All this is so obviously true, that 
it is difficult to believe that Trance can really be trying 
to get us to evacuate Egypt, and is not merely worrying 
usin Cairo in order to extort concessions elsewhere. 
Like the Irishman, she cherishes her grievances and 
keeps it in good repair as a valuable national 
asset. Possibly, however, this is too far fetched. In 
that case we must assume that France is too much 
blinded by vexation to see her own interests. Anyhow, 
itis abundantly clear that I’rance is, in fact, doing her 
very best to indefinitely postpone the evacuation of 
Egypt. 





THE INDIAN IMPORT DUTIES. 


above party considerations, the House of 
Commons has, by a sweeping majority, refused to 
subordinate Indian finance to the interests of Lancashire. 
Tne demand that, no matter what other taxes might 
have to be imposed, or other measures taken in order to 
balance the Indian Budget, cotton goods should be held 
sacred and free from any impost, was, indeed, one to 
which not even Sir Henry James, with all his forensic 
skill, could impart an air of reasonableness. And it is 
to be presumed that it was the lack of any good arguments 


that led him to speak of the extension of the import 
duty to cotton goods as the outcome of an cinhakg 
alliance between the Indian officials and the Bombay 
millowners. Quite contrary to fact, he declared that the 
Indian deficit was mainly due to the increased exchange 
compensation allowances, and then proceeded to say :— 
‘The Government had to make up that deficit, and the 
course taken by the officials was to look round and see 
how they could find the means of ‘persuading the 
Government that they could receive this addition to their 
superannuations, pensions, pay, and allowances. They had 
friends in this country. The Bombay industry has 
become very powerful. The Bombay Millowners’ Asso- 
ciation was at hand, and the Bombay Milowners’ 
Association held out their hands to the Civil servants of 
India, and appealed to them for help to start this — 
tion to secure an import duty, and from that mala uty 
to find the means of paying the increase to the super- 
annuations, pensions, y, and allowances to the Anglo- 
Indian officials.” r Fowler subsequently resented 
very warmly this utterly unjustifiable imputation 
against the honesty and good faith of the’ Indian officials 
—an imputation which it isto be hoped Sir Henry James 
will see the Reopeiety of withdrawing as publicly asi 
was made. But in any case, that he have: 
fall back upon such an absurdity as this

spiracy as an argument against the cotton duties a | 
to what extreme lengths he was driven to find anything | 
to bolster up his case. 
In the course of the discussion a good deal of stress 
was laid upon the difference between the position of 
India and that of our colonies. As self-governing com- 
munities, the colonies, it was said, have the right to 
arrange their own fiscal affairs, and if they chose to | 
place import duties upon our products, however misguided | 
they may be, we have no right to object. ‘Lhe financial | 
administration of India, on the contrary, 1s in our own | 
hands, and we ought not to suffer there any departure 
from the Free-trade policy which we consider the best in | 
the interests of the whole community. Those who | 
argue thus, however, find it convenient to ignore the fact 
that there is scarcely a Crown Colony in which import 
duties are not levied. Consequently, what they are 
contending for is, that we shall place upon India fiscal | 
restraints which we do not impose upon any other of our | 
dependencies. This it is sought to justify on the 
ground that, as our trade with these dependencies is 
small, the import duties levied by them do not hurt us 
much ; but that it is very different when we have to 
deal with such an enormous volume of trade as that 
which passes between this country and India. But 
apart from the question as to whether British 
interests alone are to enter into consideration, ; 
is it a prudent principle to lay down that so long as | 
mother country it is to be left reasonably free to arrange 
its own fiscal affairs, but that if it buys largely of our 
products that freedom isto be denied it? Further, if we 
are justified in insisting upon a right of free entry of | 
our goods into India because it is so important a market, | 
surely India has an equal right to demand free entry 
for all her products here. Yet we derive from the 
taxation of Indian tea alone a larger revenue than India | 
expects to derive from the 5 per cent. import duty upon | 
all British products. 
It is asserted by Lancashire that even with the counter- 
vailing excise, the import duty on cotton goods must 
prove protective. But this is strenuously denied by the 
Indian producers, and so far the evidence tends to 
support the latter contention. Manchester certainly 
does not now compete, nor has she for very many years 
competed, with the Indian factories in the lower counts 
of yarn which are exempt from the countervailing excise, 
and it may be taken for granted that if there are any 
signs of the Indian mills developing competition in the 
higher counts, these willbe very speedily discovered, and 
brought under the notice of the Government. Any such 
representations Mr Forster has promised to consider 
with the utmost care, and, indeed, such a promise was 
hardly necessary, for the political influence of Lanca- 
shire is too great to be ignored if brought to bear upon 
any legitimate grievance. As it is, however, the import 
duty on cotton goods countervailed by the excise is 
much more justifiable on the Free-trade principles to which 
Lancashire appeals than the like duty on other British 
products with which there is Indian competition but on 
which there is no countervailing excise, or than the 
Indian export duty on rice. 








THE NEW UNITED &TATES LOAN. 


We do not wish to press further the point we raised 
last week as to the true character of the new United 
States loan. According to President Cleveland’s 
calculations, if Congress had agreed to make the new 
bonds specifically payable in gold, the interest charged 
would have been reduced by fully £107,800 per annum, 
‘‘ amounting in thirty years, or at the maturity of the coin 
bonds, to $16,174,770,” or close upon £3,236,000. And 
if after having deliberately elected to pay that sum in 
order to have the option of discharging the claims of the 
bondholders in silver coin, the Government and the

Legislature should still elect to pay in gold coin, it 
is certainly not for people here to object, nor to 
tell them that they are wasting money. At the same: 
time, however, the fact that they have agreed in con- 
sideration of a higher rate of interest to accept payment 
in silver, and have thus put themselves on a different 
footing from the other creditors of the Government, is 
a fact which it would be foolish for those who have 
subscribed to the new issue to ignore. It will not do for 
them to say that the United States Government is under 
a statutory obligation to maintain the parity between 
gold and silver coin, for obviously, if they had believed in 
the complete validity and continuing force of that obliga- |} 
tion, there would have been no reason for differentiating |f 
between a gold and a “coin” loan. But leaving that 
phase of the subject, the question arises whether Pres.dent 
Cleveland and his advisers have not aggravated a good 
deal any pecuniary loss which the perversity of the 
Legislature has entailed. The new loan has certainly 
proved an immense success—for the syndicate. Speaking 
broadly, it was taken by them at 104}, and its issue 
price averaged 113. The difference between those two 
rates on a loan of £13,000,000 represents a sum of 
fully £1,100,000, which may be taken as the price the 
United States Government have had to pay for the 
services of the syndicate. Indeed, the payment may be 
put at a higher figure, for the bonds are at a premium 
of fully 6 per cent. over the issue price, and it may be 
assumed that, if the United States ,Government 
had appealed to investors direct, it would have 
been able to realise to its own advantage some- 
thing of that higher price. It would appear, there- 
fore, that President Cleveland appraised at too low 
a figure the credit of the United States, impaired 
although that has been of late. In any case, he has 


lesson upon the evil of tampering with the currency in 
addition to that afforded by the higher rate of interest 
payable upon the “coin” bonds. Financial syndicates 
are an expensive luxury with which a great and wealthy 
nation like the United States ought to be able to dispense. 
When Mr Goschen carried out his conversion scheme, 
the entire cost in commissions to agents, other than 
the Banks of England and Ireland, incurred in 
converting £558,000,000 of 3 per Cents., was £234,000. 
And now we see the United States compelled to 
allow intermediaries to earn a profit of over £1,000,000 
on % loan of £13,000,000. Of course, the labourer 
is worthy of his hire, and no one would dream 
of blaming the syndicate for making the best possible 
terms for themselves. But if the monetary affairs of the 
States had been managed with ordinary prudence, their 
services would notjhave been needed, and, as the avidity 
with which the loan has been taken up may possibl 
have a bad effect in causing the Legislature to thin 
that, after all, their pranks have done no very great 
harm, and thus encourage them in their folly, it is 
desirable that this fact should be emphasised. . 
It now remains to be seen whether the Treasury will 
be able to retain the gold with which the syndicate has 
undertaken to supply it, or whether that, in its 
turn, will be drained away, as was the proceeds of 
the two former loans. As to that, it is too early 
yet to form any definite opinion. No doubt the arrange- 
ment with the syndicate should strengthen the hands of 
the Treasury, for the contracting firms are powers in the 
bullion market, and can do a great deal to influence the 
gold movements. It is hoped, too, that the effect of 
their co-operation will be to increase confidence in the 
ability of the Treasury to maintain gold payments, an 
so tend to put a stop to any precautionary withdrawals of 
the metal. For our part, however, we do not believe 
that there can be any real revival of confidence until the 
Legislature can be got to deal with the currency in & 
sensible fashion. And when it is said that the revenue 
is now improving, and that the Treasury will be able to 
reduce the amount of paper currency outstanding, 
and so limit the power of the market to take gold from 
it by presenting notes for payment, it has to be pointed 
out that as yet the revenue still falls short of the 
expenditure, and that if later on the Treasury was in

GERMANY AND BI-METALLISM. 


Ir is only natural that the bi-metallists should attach 
an exaggerated importance to Prince Hohenlohe’s reply 
to the motion advocating the calling together of another 
International Monetary Conference, which was brought 
forward in the Imperial Diet at the end of last week. 
At the conclusion of the debate, the Chancellor read 
| what he characterised as a ‘‘carefully-drafted declaration” 
of which the text is as follows :—‘‘ Without prejudicing 
‘‘our Imperial currency, one must confess that the 
‘‘ differences in value between gold and silver continue 
“‘ to react uponour commercial life. Following out the train 
‘‘ of thought which led to the convocation of the Silver 
‘‘ Inquiry Commission, I am ready to consider, in con- 
‘junction with the Federal Governments, whether we 
‘« cannot enter into a friendly interchange of opinions as

And as the bi-metallists have received so |

statement, and profess to regard it as evidence that if the | attempted to raise, capital in this country the shares of

As soon as that had been constituted, Count 
Alvensleben, the dclegate of Germany, made a declara- 


‘ing its basis. The Imperial Government does not, 
‘“« however, fail to recognise that the continual oscillation 
‘‘and the considerable fall of silver are much to be 
‘‘ regretted from an economic point of view, and that it 
‘“* would be to the advantage of the Empire if these evils 
‘* could be remedied in a lasting manner.” This explicit 
declaration by Germany of an intention to maintain the 
gold basis of its currency went far to put international 
bi-metallism beyond the pale of discussion, and the 
Conference had to content itself with the consideration of 
some subsidiary schemes for increasing the monetary 
use of silver. And it is quite evident from Prince 
Hohenlohe’s statement that this obstacle to any inter- 
national agreement remains. The German Government 
is willing now, as it was in 1892, to consider any measures 
that may be suggested for steadying and raising the price 
of silver, but it is as determined now as it was then not to 
do anything to alter the basis of, or, as Prince Hohenlohe 
now puts it, to prejudice, the Imperial currency. 

It is obvious also that the idea of convening another 
International Conference to talk at large upon the silver 
question finds no favour with the German Govern- 
ment. Prince Hohenlohe did not say this in so 
many words because his object was to manceuvre 
out of a difficult Parliamentary position. Evidently, 
however, he clearly recognises the fact that after 
the failure of two Conferences, the Power that again 
proposes international action must have some detinite 
scheme to put forward. And certainly the German 
Government is not in that position. The Silver Inquiry

WESTERN AUSTRALIAN EXPLOITATION. 


AFTER a period of comparative slackness, promoters who 
are anxious to interest British investors in the exploita- 
tion of Western Australia have lately shown renewed 
activity, and it will clearly be from no want of energy on 
their part if the amount of capital sunk in the various 
goldfields of the colony does not assume very important 
dimensions. When we last dealt at length with the 
subject, in our issue of December 22nd last, we men- 
tioned that the Western Australian mining concerns 
thus far offered on this side represented a capitalisation 
of close upon £6,000,000. Since then the aggre- 
gate has been increased to nearly £7,509,000; 
but a large number of the attempts to raise capital 
proved abortive, while in some instances where 
the companies have proceeded to allotment, the actual 
amount subscribed has been comparatively small, the 
promoters and underwriters trusting to future market 
manipulation to place the balance of the capital. Out 
of about one hundred companies that have raised, or 


in some instances ‘‘ going concerns’’ were taken over, 


panies, and Bayley’s Reward Company. Of course, 


work to take place to render the making of profits 
practicable. It is not to be disputed, however, that the 
experience of Bayley’s Reward Company of late has been 
detrimental to the interests of the exploiters. For a time 
this company made regular returns of 700 oz of gold 
weekly, from 70 tons of quartz, and even less, and on the 
strength of these yields the original capital, amounting 
to £24,000, was written up to £480,000. Gradually the 
rich mineral gave out, the last returns being under 14 oz 
of gold to the ton. The shares have, therefore, fallen 
apout 60 per cent.; and though with proper and syste- 
matic development the mine may yet give a good account 
of itself, its {record has proved, as we anticipated, that 
permanent success in mining is much more likely where, 
as in the Rand, the gold-content of the quartz is small, 
than where mineral of phenomenal richness is discovered. 

That many of the Western Australian mines will pro-, 
duce satisfactory results is highly probable, for the 
existence of extensive gold-fields has now been proved in 
several distinct districts; and though the water supply 
may prove a source of recurring difficulty, it is reason- 
able to assume that during a large proportion of the year 
mining operations will be practicable on a large scale. 
So far, indeed, the progress made in the extraction of 
gold has been quite satisfactory, as the following state- 
ments, which are extracted from the Australian Mail, 
show :—‘‘ The quantity and value (£3 16s per oz) obtained 
from the respective goldfields during 1894 are given as 
under: Kimberley, 588 oz 12 dwt 17 gr, £2,236 16s 4d;

The defendants placed some of the shares, and were 
paid by the directors of the company out of the company’s 
assets a sum of £26103. The company subsequently 
went into liquidation, and this was an action by the. 
liquidator to recover the sum of money so paid. The 
claim was based on two ground:; the first, that the 
directors had no power to make such a payment ; the 
second, that there was no contract between the company 
and the brokers. Both these claims the Recorder 
decided against the company, the result being that the 
payment to the brokers was upheld. 

The Recorder, on the second point, held that there 
was an implied contract on the part of the company to 
pay a reasonable remuneration to the brokers for placing 
these shares. This ruling is important, inasmuch as it 
amounts to a legal recognition of the custom which exists 
of paying a commission to all brokers through whom 
applications for shares in new companies are sent in, 
without regard to the question whether or no there had 
been an express agreement between the company and the 
brokers to that effect. The first point, however, viz., the 
question whether such payments are intra vires of the 
directors, is the crucial one, and the one on which the 
second obviously hinges. It was suggested that the 
payment by the company of this brokerage amounted 
to an issue of shares ata discount. This view, how- 
ever, Sir Charles Hall refused to accept, and there 
can be no doubt that his decision is in accord with 
the authorities. There is, of course, a wide distinc- 
tion (though the practical result to the company may 
not be very different) between issuing a share to an 
applicant at less than its nominal value, and issuing 
a share to an applicant for its full nominal value, at 
the same time paying a commission out of the 
applicant’s money to the person who induced him 
to subscribe—the commission in such a case being in 
the nature of a preliminary expense. Indeed, when it 1s 
borne in mind that the Court of Appeal have decided that 
“underwriting at a discount’’ meant underwriting at & 
commission, and that the transaction was not illegal, a3 
amounting to an issue of shares at a discount, it may be, 
taken as reasonably clear that paying a broker for placing, 
shares is not issuing them at adiscount. 

The real difficulty in the case arises from a decision of 
Lord Justice Kay, when a judge of first instance, in the 
case of the Faure Electric Accumulator Company. . In 
that case he held that the payment of brokerage or com- 
mission to a stockbroker for placing a companys 
shares was (apart from any question of discount) a2, 
improper application of its capital, and was nob 
‘authorised by a power given by the memorandum .of 
association to do. whatever might be ‘‘conducive’”’ to the 
objects of the company: He accordingly ordered the. 
directors who had paid such a brokerage to jointly and 
severally repay it to the company, with 4 per cent. 
interest. This decision has been the subject of some

Jt is int®resting, too, to observe, that the production of 
ihe precious metal last year showed a steady rate of 
progression quarter by quarter. In the first quarter it 
amounted to 35,363 oz, in the second to 40,450 oz, in 
the third to 62,846 oz, and in the fourth to 67,567 oz. 
As a large amount of exploratory work has been done 
during the past six months, it is to be hoped that the 
output during the current and succeeding years will show 
a further and continuous expansion. 

Among the points which investors have to bear in mind 
in considering whether or not to subscribe to mining 
yentures, are the nature of the statements put forward, 
i the reputation of the experts whose opinions are quoted, 
| and the sufficiency or otherwise of the provision of work- 
| ing capital. Now, we are bound to admit that in very 

my cases the amount set aside for working capital 
promises tobe quite inadequate, while in very many 
a'so the purchase considerations are altogether excessive. 
| In the caseof a fully developed and equipped property 
| the owners are, of course, entitled to ask not only for the 
| return of their outlay, but for a substantial reward also 

if that outlay has produced satisfactory results; but 
in the cases of unworked areas, it is too much 
, that those who run the whole risk of finding the 
capital for developing the areas should be asked to 
do soon the basis of receiving afourth or a fifth of what- 
ever profits their capital may produce. That is a point 
we have urged so frequently that we need not enlarge 
upon it now. 

The other material fact which investors should 
cndeayour to ascertain before subscribing is the kind of 
people who have the business in hand. As the law at 
) present stands, it is often very difficult to get such 
information, but later on we may hope that the difficulty

adverse criticism, but it stands as an authority, and as 
the ruling of an undoubtedly strong judge. The 
decision of Sir Charles Hall, unless perhaps it can be 
supported on the suggested ground that the articles of asso- 
ciation justified the payment of brokerage, appears to fly in 
the very teeth of the decision of Lord Justice Kay, and 
it must, moreover, be remembered in the case of the 
former judge that his judgments are not reported in the 
authorised reports, and do not amount to ‘ authorities.” 
Lord Justice Kay, in arriving at his decision, was clearly 
influenced by the consideration that the payment of a 
company’s capital for the placing of shares was ‘‘ calcu- 
lated to lead to a great amount of evil in the commercial 
world. It ought tobe discouraged.” No one who has 
followed the revelations of the last three or four years 
can doubt that the learned judge’s remarks are unfortu- 
nately more than justified. He then proceeded to state 
that such an application of the company’s capital could 
not have been sancticned by a general meeting of the 
company, and was, therefore, clearly wltra vires of the 
directors. Under these circumstances it is clear that 
the legality of paying a brokerage of this description is a 
question open to considerable doubt, the preponderance 
of authority at the present time being againat the practice. 
Directors making such a payment would consequently do 
well to remember that they do so at some appreciable 
personal risk. 





MR HAMILTON SMITH ON THE RAND GOLD-FIELDS. 


RaTHER more than two years ago, Mr Hamilton Smith, 
the well-known mining expert, published a report based 
upon his examination of the Witwatersrand gold-fields 
in the preceding year, and the report naturally attracted 
a large amount of attention, as it was generally known 
that the investigations had been conducted on behalf of 
a leading financial house. After an interval of a couple 
of years, Mr Hamilton Smith again visited the Rand, 
remaining there from August until December last, and 
he has this week addressed tothe Times a communica- 
tion stating in what degree his original conjectures have 
been verified by the actual work of mining and develop- 
ment during the past two years. In the first report the 
belief was expressed that in a few years the gold product 
from the Rand would increase to a value of over 
£10,000,000 per annum, and that ‘a total yield of 
£325,000,000 in gold could reasonably be expected from 
this one district, this future product being chiefly 
dependent upon four things, viz :—VFirst, will the 
‘ Main Reef series’ continue to great depths? Second, 
if they do, what will be their general inclination or dip, 
and to what vertical depth will it be practicable to work 
them? Third, what amount of gold will be found with 
increased depths? Fourth, on how large a scale can 
mining operations be conducted ?” 

Mr Hamilton Smith is more modest in his estimates 
than Professor Schmeisser, who calculated that from the 
central part of the district gold would be obtained of the 
value of £352,000,000 ; but neitherexpert makesit at all clear 
upon what basis hisestimatesare made,and neither ventures 
to suggest what amount of the gross product is likely to 
be divisible profit. Since 1892 about sixty mines owning 
claims at and near the surface outcrop of the main reef 
series have been worked, and from these in the past two 
years some 5,000,000 tons of ore have been extracted. 
During the same period it is stated that many vertical 
bore-holes have been put down by diamond drills to the 
dip of the series, one of them having reached a depth of 
nearly 2,500 feet, while several shafts have been sunk 
upon “ deep level” properties, finding the reefs of the 
Series at vertical depths of from 600 feet to 1,000 feet. 
‘With regard to the probable dip of the strata in depth, 
Mr Hamilton Smith says:—‘' The surface dip of the 
strata varies at different sections, gencrally being quite 
steep at the outcrop of the series, and then flattening to 
inclinations of from 40 deg. to 20 deg. for a distance of 
& couple of miles. In other sections the dipis as gradual 
as 23 deg. at the outcrop, becoming as steep as 45 deg. 
-at-a distance of a mile. My general conclusion is that 
at a-horizontal distance of three miles from their out- 
crop, the reefs of the main series are probably 








10,000 feet, or about two miles, beneath the sur- 
face, and at a distance of two miles their depth, 
as a rule, will be not quite one and a-half miles.” 
Assuming that working on a large scale will be possible 
at adepth of 3,000 feet, Mr Hamilton Smith estimates 
the first cost for plant and development, before any 
returns can be expected, at £600,000, which, as he says, 
is @ large sum, ‘‘and before such an expenditure is 
determined upon the investor ought to be well assured as 
to the probable value of the ore and the costs of working.” 
This £600,000 estimate will come as an uncomfortable 
revelation to those who have been imagining that the 
working expenditure necessary to the development of the 
deep levels and their continuations would be little, if at 
all, in excess of the expenditure of the outcrop 
companies. . 

Although it is impossible to say what amount of water 
will be found at serious depths, like 3,000 feet, Mr 
Hamilton Smith states that, judging from present indica- 
tions, the chances are that the inflow will not be so large 
even at depths as to add very materially to the cost of 
mining, while his investigations in regard to the question 
of heat have led him to the conclusion that at 3,000 feet 
the temperature would be about 100 deg., and that such 
a temperature would not add greatly to the mining costs, 
butat 3,500 feet there would probably be a serious addition 
to the miningcost. The report goes on tosum up the facts 
in the following manner: ‘I think with present con- 
ditions the conclusion is warranted that with ‘most of 


the mines a vertical working depth of but little over. 


3,000 feet can be assumed as the limit with which they 
can be operated at a profit, while with richer or thicker 
ore, such as is now found in a few of the outcrop mines, 
a limit of something over 3,500 feet in depth seems 
reasonable. Should, however, the price of skilled labour 
and the cost of supplies decline in time to a European 
level, still deeper limits would be possible.” Mr 
Hamilton Smith thus stops far short of those who 
have lately been talking about the profitable working of 
the district at 6,000 feet in depth and more. He further 
states that, so far as can be ascertained, the average 
value of the reefs remains unchanged to a vertical depth 
of 1,000 feet, say 1,750 feet upon their dip, the yield 
varying from 8 dwt to 27 dwt per ton, and adds: “I 
was greatly surprised during my late visit to find that 
this variation remains so nearly constant with increased 
depths. I cannot but think that this will alter when 
much greater depths are attained, so that in years to 
come better ore will be found under mines which are 
now poor, and poorer ore under mines which are now 
high grade.”” Mr Hamilton Smith estimates that when 
the full thickness of the reefs is fully mined, the average 
yield will be less than 13 dwts per ton, taking the 
district as a whole. 


the deep level mines will be fairly productive, and that 
by the end of the century the maximum production of 
about £12,500,000 may be expected. The report con- 
tinues:—‘‘In addition to the yield which may be 
expected from the main reef series, I think in a few 
years a considerable quantity of gold will be produced 
from other reefs, especially from what is called the 
‘black reef.’ This reef, with perhaps one exception, 
thus far appears to be what in mining parlance is called 
‘spotted,’ the ore varying greatly in value in the distance 
of a few feet. Very likely more money will be lost than 
made in working this deposit, but the gold from it may 
in time add appreciably to the bullion output of the dis- 
trict,” a matter which will scarcely console thoss who 
lose their money in the operation. te 
Mr Hamilton Smith points out that the dividends paid 
so far have been equal to about 19 per eant. of the gold 
produced ; but he gives no estimate of waat the future 
rate of profits is likely to be, probably because he thinks 
that no accurate estimate is possible. The following

the effect of inducing men to expend large sums in 
exploiting mines, with disastrous financial results, so that 
in the long run the aggregate losses have often been 
greater than the aggregate profits. The Rand deposits 
are, hovvever, so much more regular than have been the 
case with previous gold deposits or lodes, that it is almost 
certain that in the next twenty years or more the profits 
for working them will much exceed the losses. Still, 
the investor should remember that even on the Rand 
there are mines and mines—some good and some poor— 
and that, in order to avoid losses, careful discrimination 
in his ventures will be necessary. The excellence 
of these mines is not due to their exceeding rich- 
ness, but to large continuous bodies of ore of moderate 
grade. In order to work them profitably, first-rate

slalfully and economically managed I thivk it is safe 
to say that there are now on the Rand not more than 
three or four mines which would yield any considerable 
profit were their management radically bad; hence, the 
investor should in advance inform himself as to this 
important point. From the regularity which has thus 
far characterised the reefs, it is now not very difficult to 
make a pretty fair guess as to the length of life which 
each mine will have; hence, one should determine first 
the rate of interest at which he is willing to risk his 
will be to protect his capital. As to expected profits, 
past results now afford a pretty Tair guide, but the 
should not forget that nearly every 


iining man—I do not claim to be an exception—is 


over sanguine when counting upon future mining 
profits.” Mr Hamilton Smith’s report is full of interest ; 
it is couched in terms which show that the writer is 


; 


fully alive to the responsibility attaching to his name 
aid position, and it is, therefore, deserving of the careful 
perusal of mining shareholders generally, though, of 
course, of especial importance to those who are con- 
cerned in the Rand district. 





THE SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION OF WOOL. 

Jusras, in Peter the Great’s day, the Russian’s beard 
was an essential portion of his religious belief, so to-day 
a pious faith in the non-combustibility of wool appears 
to be essential to every man who devotes himself to the 
purchase or sale of the fleecy product of the sheep. 
Therefore, when last April we ventured to call attention 
to certain facts which seemed to us to point very plainly 
to the present day liability of colonial wool to spontaneous 
combustion, and were, in consequence, assailed with all 
the confidence and vigour of an Athanasian creed, we 
were not greatly astonished. Ouraim had been to demon- 
strate that wool becomes, in certain conditions, 
probably attributable to damp packing in the colonies, 
a very dangerous article of cargo whilst at sea, and 
possibly may remain a danger even when delivered 
into warehouse at this side. From the reception 
accorded to our remarks, both here and in the colonies, 
it was to be inferred that the trade regarded us as 
inspired with an evil design to “ melt the city leads upon 
their pates’’ in the form of enhanced premiums of fire 
insurance for warehouse risks. It had not, we confess, 
suggested itself to us that our interest in a subject of 
such great importance to the safety of lives and property 
at sea was thus to be accounted for. However, we live 
and learn. Our contemporary, the Melbourne Argus, 
dealing with the question on broad grounds, stigmatised 
our statements as such as no practical man in the trade 
would accept, the universal experience having been that 
wool is not inflammable, and that it is impossible to burn 
it. Now, the Melbourne Argus ought certainly tobe allowed 
to know something about wool, and such an expression 
of opinion from such a source would, if uncontradicted, 
no doubt have weakened the impression which it was 


our object to create. Fort l 
Joba ised ek ortunately, however, Messrs

ee 


[February 23, 1895, 








this eminent firm, from it being the universal experience 
that it was impossible to burn wool, they had evidence 
to prove that, under certain conditions, wool is highly 
inflammable. And we gather from the tenor of their 
remarks that they shared our conviction that the con- 
ditions referred to originate in damp packing. As the 
result no doubt of the attention thus drawn to the subject, 
in conjunction with the growing frequency of fires on wool- 
laden vessels, a committee of inquiry was appointed by 
the Legislative Council in NewZealand. Our readers will 
no doubt remember that on September 22nd last we 
reprinted from the Otago Daily Times a reference to the 
subject. And the same journal observed that at the very 
time when the appointment of this committee was being 
moved for in the Council, the crew of the new mail 
steamer “Gothic” were hard at work breaking out 
recently-laden wool, which had evidently been shipped 
in damp condition. ‘‘The heat was so intense,” it was 
stated, ‘‘ that it was impossible to put one’s hand amongst 
the bales, and the wool in some of them was scorched. 
Had the ‘Gothic’ gone to sea with this wool on board 
a fire would almost certainly have broken out before she 
was many days on her voyage. This is the third occa- 
sion within a few months on which cargo has had to be 
broken out in homeward-bound ships at this port to get 
rid of wool which was heated through being packed in a 
damp condition.” Since then, several similar cases 
have, we understand, arisen at one or other of 
the colonial wool ports. The conclusion arrived 
at by the New Zealand Commission is not before us, but 
we believe that, the facts notwithstanding, the report 
was practically abortive. If this impression be correct, 
such a conclusion is, in the general interest, much to be 
deplored. 

So far we have no information of anything in the 
nature of general inquiry in any of the Australian 
colonies, but the local underwriters, evidently alarmed, i 
have apparently been dealing with the matter on their 
own account. The result of certain investigations set on 
foot by the Sydney Underwriters’ Association has, in 
fact, come before us, and very interesting we find it. We 
gather that certain wool either shipped or tendered for 
shipment at Sydney, having been found to show signs of 
heating, was returned to store. Thereupon the Associa- 
tion applied to the Technical Education Branch 
of the Department of Public Instruction to nominate a 
scientific expert to examine the wool, and also the 
washing works from which it had been sent for shipment. 
An expert was sent accordingly from the Sheep and Wool 
Department, and to the detailed report of this gentleman 
we are now able to refer. The expert inspected thirteen 
bales. Of these he pronounced six to be passable or 
sound, and condemned the remainder. This is, in brief, 
what he says of the latter, seriatim :— 

1. Upon drawing sample from centre of bale it was a 
little warm, and must be looked upon as suspicious. 
Badly scoured. 

2. Very dangerous. Hot, clammy, dirt not washed 
out, and not properly dried. 

3. Heating, not clean, heavy, and sticky. 
dangerous. 

4. Very bad all through, much heated, worst in 
centre. In avery dangerous state. 

5. Heating; not clean, dangerous. 

6. Hot, badly treated in scouring, and pressed damp. 
Very dangerous. 

7. Hot, heavy, and in a dangerous state. 


So much for the wool. As to the washing works, itis un- 
necessary here to follow the expertin his various comments 
upon them, interestingthoughthese be. The worksthem- 
selves were declared to be “ all that can be desired and ex- 
cellent in every respect,” but evidently the working system 
was in need of alteration. ‘ At the second works visited,” 
says the expert, ‘I fcund the wool that was being pressed - 
certainly damp, and should not have been put into the 
bales........ - In conclusion, I would say without reserve, 
that the whole of the fault in the objectionable bales of 
wool is certainly due to the manner in which the wool is 
rushed through the washing machines and the drying. 


It simply wants more time in all stages of handling, and 
then all trouble will end.” a ae ae

that the exigencies of the case provide an inducement to 
settle on some terms rather than to hold out for a full 
and equitable arrangement. But bondholders as @ body 
have come to regard the Council as a machine for making 
settlements. They say, in effect, you have all the means 
at your disposal for bringing about an_adjustment 
of the position between our debtors and ourselves, 
and we look to you to bring the negotiations to 
a satisfactory conclusion. It thus happens that foreign 
defaulting States are occasionally able to secure a more 
advantageous bargain than would be possible if the bond- 
holders and those who represent them displayed rather 
more backbone and fixed determination to hold out for 
an equitable settlement. It is, therefore, to be hoped 
that in future negotiations of the kind both the bond- 
holders generally and the Council will show a more 
united front, and absolutely refuse to participate in any 
whitewashing arrangement unless, and until, justice 
is done as between creditors and debtors, for, as matters 


atand, the latter too frequently score at the expense of 
the former.

British Shipping in 1894.—The tables issued by 
Lloyd's, giving the additions to and removals from the 
British mercantile marine during the past year, show 
that the total additions made consisted of 833 vessels, 
registering'921,743 gross tons. Of this tonnage 811,859 
tons was steam, and 109,834 tons sailing tonnage. 
Of the total, additions nearly 93 per cent. wera new 
vessels all of which were British-built, the remainder 
consisting chiefly of vessels bought from abroad, or 
transferred from the colonies. The total deductions from 
the register on account of wreckage, breaking-up, and 
sales amounted to 942 vessels of 570,004 tons, leaving 
the net addition to tonnage 351,739 tons gross, while 
there was a net decrease of 109 in the number of vessels.

The increase of tonnage was thus entirely confined to 
steel-built vessels, each of the other classes showing 
a heavy falling off. The removals from the Register 
include an exceptionally large tonnage sold to foreigners, 
and it appears that nearly one-half the vessels so dis- 
posed of were iron steamers, the tonnage of that class 
amounting to 128,198 tons out of the total of 262,033 
tons. Astatement is appended to the returns showing 
the destination of the vessels sold abroad, and it is inter- 
esting to observe that Japan was our best customer, 
taking 24 vessels of 61,912 tons, all steamships. Norway 
comes next with 40,721 tons, more than one-half of 
which was sailing tonnage. Italy’s quota was~24,717 
tons, I'rance and Spain bought just over 20,000 tons 
each, and Denmark 15,000 tons. With the exception 
of Holland, no other country took more than 10, 
tons. It may be added that the vessels on the Register 


of the United Kingdom on December 31, 1894, were 
approximately as follows :—

$16,000,000 on the forthcoming bond issue by inserting 
tae words ‘payable in gold” instead of “payable in 
coin.” 

An unusual feature of the financial transaction under 
discussion consists in its not being a sale of Government 
bonds, as were the preceding issues, but consists in the 
purchase, by means of specially issued Government 
bonds, of 3,500,000 ounces of gold coin-fine. Theoretically, 
of course, every disposition of produce or product, 
whether in barter or for cash, within a certain sense is a 
sale each way, and it must be admitted that as the 
syndicate of bankers agree to furnish the Government 
3,500,000 ounces of gold at $17:80} per ounce, as 
against $18-604 per ounce (which is what the Govern- 
ment pays for bullion coin-fine), they are paying a 
premium of $2,800,000 for bonds which are ostensibly 
issued to purchase gold. From this it is evident the 
syndicate will get the bonds at about $104-49 per $100, 
or 32 per cent. net, while the bonds are nominally a 4 
per cent. issue. Inasmuch as the gold in the Treasury 
at the present time amounts to about $42,769,000, the 
3,500,000 ounces of gold will represent an additional 
$65,117,500 secured, and bring the total in the Treasury 
up to $107,887,000. 

An interesting study in connection with the forthcoming 
issue will be found in the comparison of the rate at 
which these bonds are to be issued, with the rates at 
which preceding issues were sold, inasmuch as_ it 
will afford an opportunity for conjecture as to the price 
to which this new issue of bonds will attain in the near 
future, and the effect on other Government issues. The 
preceding Government bond issues sold yesterday at 
something more than 110 with the tendency downward, 
and inasmuch as it is a short term bond, compared with 
that coming, and is at a lower rate of interest, it may 
not be considered improbable that these new bonds with 
thirty years to run, paying 3? per cent. net, will soon be 
recognised as a gilt-edge investment. 

The credit of the Government cannot be expected to 
divide itself up in varying proportions as applied to the 
various Government obligations and quotations for each 
series of Government bonds must tend to equalise with 
reference to periods during which they have to run, rates 
of interest they pay, and other elements going to make 
up relative desirability. It is not at all improbable this 
latest issue will sell from 7 to 8 points higher than the 
figure at which it is to be issued within a short time, 
which will cause it to be quoted considerably higher 
than either of the preceding Government issues. Owing 
to the relatively small amount to be issued, it is not 
unlikely that shortly after these bonds are issued, a 
shrinkage will be noticed in quotations of other issues. 

Instead of issuing more bonds for the maintenance of 
the Treasury gold reserve under the Act of 1875, the 
President resurrected a revised statute of March 17, 
1862, which followed the passage of the Legal Tender 
Act, wken gold was at a premium, and was intended to 
empower the Treasury to supply gold to meet the demand 
for the same on presentation of legal tenders. It 
empowers the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase coin 
with any of the bonds or notes of the United States 
authorised by law, at such rates and upon such terms as 
he may deem most judicious to the public interest. 

Wall Street exhibited, as intimated, surprise from one 
end to the other when the announcement of the nature 
of the President’s message was received, and it is entirely 
proper to add that bankers and others in the Street, 
while, in many instances, commending the President for 
his action, found fault with the evidence given of the 
effect on our public credit by the attitude of Con- 
gress of late months. The deadlock on financial 
questions at Washington, together with the higher rate 
the Government appears to be obliged to pay for gold 
resulted in a selling movement, and the market closed 
with a decline in Grangers, Industrials, and some other 
4) securities. The fact that part of the gold to be obtained 
under the new bond arrangement shall come from abroad, 
thereby adding to the stock of the yellow metal already 
in the country, while a favorable feature, does not appear 
to be of sufficient weight to affect the foreign exchange 
market materially, as it closes practically: unchanged.

The question before the country now is, will the new 
bond issue prevent a repetition of the presentation of 
legal tenders at the Treasury with demands for gold, and 
the consequent denudation of the Treasury of its reserve, 
fora third time within a year and a-half. With the 
improvement in conditions affecting the national 
Treasury, which means increased revenues, @ number of 
bankers have declared their opinion that no such action 
will be the result this time, although it is plain there isa 
lack of unanimity on this point. A great deal is being 
written also concerning the effect on obligations of 
corporations and municipalities of the placing of the 
Government bonds at so high a rate. It is only 
necessary to suggest this point to enable the reflective 
reader, particularly if he is an investor, to apprehend 
the possibilities. 

The blizzard, which has extended over the greater 
portion of the country this week, has resulted in a severe 
interruption to railway traffic, and a sharp restriction to 
the volume of wholesale business in all directions. The 
moderate stimulation of the retail demand for coal end for 
seasonable fabrics, clothing, shoes, &c., will, of course, 
fall far short from offsetting this loss. Prices of cereals, 
Bessemer pig-iron and a few other staples, hog products, 
live stock, fruits, vegetables, and other produce have all 
advanced, those of sugar, tin-plates, and copper almost 
alone having exhibited a tendency towards reaction. 





GERMANY. 
(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) 
Bertin, February 20. 

The bourse has been in an unsettled condition during 
the past few days, and prices unsteady. A syndicate 
has been started here—without any official connection, 
however, with the firm who first issued the Mexican loans 
—for the import and sale of the Mexican loan issued in 
London in 1893, to the amounts of £3,000,000. The 
loan is not admitted here for official quotation, but 
it is reported that large amounts of the same are being 
brought here. This latter feature must be regarded in 
connection with the energetically fostered belief in a 
recovery of silver, first by the expected requirements of 
China and Japan after the war, and secondly by legisla- 
tive measures and conventions between the Govern- 
ments. There is nothing to support the latter assumption, 
but it reflects exactly the impression made on the public 
mind by the agrarian propaganda and by some political 
speeches. The Imperial Chancellor, Prince Hohenlohe, 
has just promised to the agrarians and bi-metallists that 
the Government will propose something like another 
International Conference on the question of bi-metallism ; 
and although the speech contained no encouraging 
word to the bi-metallists, the latter see now fit to 
speak as if they had won their game. This 
is, of course, a false interpretation of the Chan- 
cellor's speech. The uncertainty thus created has 
already led to the fear that loans on mortgages, which 
are repayable in gold, might by a change of legislation 
be declared to be repayable in silver. In some cases such 
loans have been called in. The fear is, of course, pre- 
mature. 

When it got known that the Austrian Credit Anstalt 
would pay a dividend of 19 fl, the ardour of bull operators 
began to cool off. This market, having lost so much 
money to Vienna through baisse operations lately, 
despaired of success, and suddenly turned round to 
follow the Aausse. Now they have been caught by a 
new decline, and operators try to get rid of part of their 
engagements. For the present the market generally 
must be described as growingly weak, and in most 
departments some fall in prices has taken place.

this merely because he did not like to trouble the Legis-

all things connected with the currency reform. The reason

The condition of the money market is unchanged ; the 
private discount rate in the open market is 1} per cent. 
The increase of the gold stock held by the Imperial Bank 









by 14 million marks shows that money is still accumu- 
lating. Some days ago report was made that the foreign 
balances at the Bank are 115 million marks larger 
than at the corresponding time last year. The metal 
stock is 210 million marks larger than at the same time 
last year. The investments are smaller. 

The Koenigs and Laura Hiitte (the leading iron and 
coal concern in Silesia) has just published its report for 
the half-year—July 1st to December 31st, 1894. Though 
it shows a slight increase of the gross gain, compared 
with the previous half-year, and though it contains 
some other favourable items, it cannot be said to afford 
any justification for the upward movement in the 
market which was started on the strength of it. It 
mentions that the domestic sales have sunk to 60 per 
cent. of the total production. The company is about to 
convert 4} per cent. bonds into 33 per Cents., and at the 
same time to issue new bonds to the amount of 3 
million marks. 

Much attention is given to the negotiations between 
the Governments of Prussia and Hessan regarding 
the purchase of the Ludwig Railway Company. 
far, no final arrangements have been made. 
prevailing opinion is that Prussia will buy the whole net 
of the company, and that Frankfort-on-the-Maine will 
be made the seat of the administration. It has been at 
Mayence ever since the foundation of the company, and 
the change would be unpleasant to some local interests at 
Mayence. The present capital value of the net has been 
calculated at 130,810,000 marks. The company, more- 
over, owns property to the value of 3 million marks.

AUSTRIA. 
(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) 


Vienna, February 19. 

The Vienna bourse continues to attribute more import- 
ance to industrial than to financial undertakings, The 
home Funds remain firm at the high prices which they 
have attained through increased foreign investments, 
but investors at home are preferring banks, railways, 
ironworks, coal mines, and other industrial concerns, 
which are gaining more importance daily in the Crown 
lands, where enterprise is not feared, where old works 
are extended, and new ones founded. On ’Change yes- 
terday, the news that the Credit Anstalt would distribute 
19 florins dividend produced an excellent impression. 
This was increased by the fact that the Credit Anstalt is 
beginning to take fresh interest in new undertakings. 
The business world is also favourably impressed by the 
Finance Minister's resolution to make an emission of 
fifty millions Gold Rente at 4 per cent., for procuring 
the gold that is still required for the currency reform, 
though there are those who consider it a great 
mistake that he did not try to obtain the sanction 
of Parliament to make the emission at a lower rate 
of interest. The Reichsrath’s sanction for the emission 
of a 4 per cent. Gold Rente was given at a less favour- 


“eo time than the present, when the State might profit 
ythe excellent situation of the money market. It is 








is more likely that the Finance Minister feared that if he 
reduced the rate of interest, the foreign investors, who have 
been very willing lately to buy Austrian stocks, would 
withdraw, and this might have a bad effect upon the 
currency reform.

Indeed, it seems impossible that the public should be 
satisfied with the florins and crowns alone so long as no 
gold is put in circulation—in change for a ten-florin note, 
ten silver crowns and a five-florin note are already 
considered a nuisance, and no one understands how ten 
silver florins, or twenty crowns, will ever be offered or 
accepted. That would be acertain way of making the 
public distrustful of the new currency and those who are

property extends over 30 German square miles—which 
is more than ‘he Emperor owns, and only less than 
Prince Schwarzenburg’s 80 German miles, and Prince 
Liechtenstein’s 50 miles, and he was anxious 
that on his land progress and order should reign in every 
detail, so that Austrian industry and agriculture owe him 
a debt of gratitude.

FIXING IRISH RENTS. 

TO THE EDITOR OF THE KUONOMIST. 

Sir,—It is stated on good authority that there is 
to be another attack upon Irish property-owners. The 
Duke of Argyll, voicing the complaints of sufferers, 
shows that one great defect of the Land Act of 1887 
is, that there is no principle laid down stating what pro- 
portion of the produce of the soil the landlord is entitled |F 
to. It is blindman’s buff, with the landlord for the |} 
victim. The absence of such a provision in the Act 
shows a great lack of constructive statesmanship. It 
was understood at the time that Lord Salisbury would 
have made a stand in the Lords against that glaring 
defect, but that he was overruled and deferred to Lord 
Cairns, the Irish ex-Lord Chancellor. It is certain that 
the Peers could have successfully carried the point. This 
omission from the Act illustrates what the great Swedish 
Chancellor said to his son when about to travel : “Go 


forth my son, and see with how little wisdom the world is 
governed.”

February 23, 1895.1 





THE ECONOMIST. 


263 





In the Economist of October 5, 1889, I investigated 
the question. According to the report of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture for May, 1889(pp. 176 to 182), 
it appears to be a common rule where farms are worked 
on shares that for the land and buildings (in some 
localities for the land only) the landlord’s share of the 
produce is 33 per cent. In old-settled counties in Ontario 
the rough rule was up till recently 33 per cent. (cash rent). 
For taxing purposes in Ontario the land and the buildings 
on the farm are valued separately. The value of the 
buildings (larger and much better than the Irish average) 
is about 20 per cent., and the land about 80 per cent. 
Practically in Ontario one-fifth of the rent is for the 
buildings and four-fifths for the land. 

The Economist of May 22, 1885, reports a ten years’ 
average production in Ireland which I quoted from in its 
issue of October 5, 1889. I also quoted from the 
official Ontario report of a five years’ average ending 
1886. For brevity, I give only the results. Increased 
Trish over Ontarian yields in percentages :--Wheat, 
average of both kinds, 53; barley, 31; oats, 5; turnips, 
13; mangolds, 8; hay and clover, 65; potatoes same in 
both countries. Values of produce per acre—excess of 
Ireland over Ontario: Wheat, 81; oats, 56; barley, 74; 
turnips, 14; hay and clover, 71. In November, 1888, 
dressed beef at Dundalk, per 100lbs, fetched 80 per cent. 
more thanin Toronto; pork, 29; and in Cork the mean of 
the first and second qualities of butter was 20 per cent. 
higher. The average increase of yield was about 25 per 
cent. The total cash value of produce per acre in Ireland 
exceeded Ontario by 42 per cent. 

According to the annual report (published 1894) of the 
Ontario Bureau of Industries, p. 93, the rental of farms 
in the old-settled Lake Ontario counties is $3:16 (at 
custom-house rate), 12s 11d per ‘cleared ” acre—about 
23 1d over the average under the Irish Land Act—and 
(p. 98) the average annual value of all crops in those 
counties 1882-3 was $15:09, or £3 1s11ld. This shows 
the average rental to have been about 21 per cent. of the 
value of the produce. But the average value of all crops 
in 1893 had fallen to $1237. That shows that the rent 
now exceeds 25 per cent. 

About fifty years ago, the late Sir Richard Griffiths— 
with his staff—valued Ireland for the purpose of local 
taxation. This rule for valuation, as stated by him in 
1844, was as follows :—For the first quality of arable land, 
one-fourth of the produce ; for second-rate arable land, 
one-sixth ; for third-rate, one-eighth. The pasture lands, 
first quality, one-half; for inferior and mountain pasture, 
one-third. More than two-thirds of the land is pasture 
of some sort. Griffiths says, ‘that if one-third be added 
to his valuation) the result wiil give very ‘‘ nearly the full 
rent value of the land.’’ He thus valued all land at 
three-fourths of its full letting value. When he valued 
land at 12s, the full letting value would be 16s. Thus, 
practically, Griffiths valued tenants’ improvements and 
buildings at one-fourth of the full rent. I have shown 
above that in Ontario, the buildings (far better than in 
Ireland) represent one-fifth of the total value of the 
farms. 

Before the 1881 Land Act, Irish farmed la1.d averaged 
about 13s 6d per acre. Under the Land Act it is now 
about 10s 10d, fluctuating slightly. On land fairly 
cultivated — by the low Irish standard—the rent pro- 
bably averages on the whole about 124 per cent., but 
in a great many cases it is far less than 10 per cent. 
This is far below Griffiths’ standard of valuation. 

It is notoriously difficult to ascertain the truth in 
Ireland. Archbishop Whateley observed that the ancients 
said that truth lay at the bottom of a deep well, but that 
after a long experience he had found that in Ireland, it 
laid at the bottom of a deep red bog. Take the notorious 
Egan case. He rented a few acres of inferior land, 
according to his own oath, for less than 8 per cent. of the 
value of the produce. The league put him forward as a 
typical case of over-renting. He refused to pay rent, was 
ejected, and brought an action to recover the value of 
the crops. He and his witnesses swore that their value 
exceeded £60—much above the Ontarian average. 

It would be fair to hark back to tae rules laid down 
by Griffiths, and acquiesced in for more than a generation ; 


that is, to allow, as he did, one-fourth of the full rent 
to the tenants for allimprovements. Either by materials, 
allowances, low rents in the nature of what are called 
repairing leases in England, a large proportion of the 
cost of buildings has been paid by the landlord in a vast 
number of cases. Landowners now suffer from the 
slovenly or no-account-keeping of their predecessors, 

If, in addition, as suggested by me in the Economist 
of October 5, 1889, landlords were allowed to pay into 
Court fourteen years’ purchase of the tenants’ interest, 
and then to have forthwith all the rights, remedies, and 
protection of landlords in Republican France, or in 
Republican New York, affairs would right themselves, 
and ina few years yields would increase one-half. At 
present landlords won't improve their tenants’ property. 

My suggestion was as follows: Take the full rent, after 
deducting for seed and agricultural horse-keep, at 30 
per cent. of the produce, the landlord’s share for the 
land to be 20 per cent., leaving the tenant 10 per cent. 
for his improvements; that is, he would retain one- 
third of the full rent for himself. Then value his interest 
at 14 years’ purchase, no deduction from rent to be 
made, as at present, for laziness or extra bad farming. 
Thus, supposing a farm, if fairly cultivated—by the Irish 
standard—would yield on an average in net saleable 
value, after deducting for seed and agricultural horse- 
keep, £200 per annum, and that the landlord had con- 
tributed nothing, either directly or indirectly, towards 
buildings, &c., the full rent at 30 per cent. would be 
£60, and the landlord’s share (for the land only) at 20 
per cet. as above, would he £40. The tenant’s share of 
the rent for the buildings would be £20. If the landlord 
wanted to buy out the tenant, he would pay into Court 
£280. Suppose a low rent was fixed, say, one-half of , 
above, then the landlord would only have to pay £140 
to get complete ownership. Therefore, it would be to his 
interest to have the rent fixed low, and the tenants to 
have it placed high. Power should be given to the 
tenant to apply to have the rent raised, and to the land- 
lord to have it lowered. 

This would be constructive statesmanship and self- 
acting. 

A statesman has no right or power to banish political 
economy to Saturn, or to suspend the work-a-day Com- 
mandments. There is, however, a discovery coming to 
the front which will indirectly tend to rectify such 
deviations from justice.—Yours, Xc.,

A REVIEW OF PRICES. 
TO THE EDITOR OF THE ECONOMIST. 


Sim,—The decline in general values since 1873 can 
only be adequately explained by a review of prices during 
the modern industrial period, starting, say, in 1782, 
t.e, 112 years ago. 

In 1782 the colonies were of little importance to the 
home country. The steam-engine was barely born; 
there were no railroads,no steamships, no Free-trade, no 
telegraphs, no Factory System, no Bessemer steel. 

Now, if some prophetic economist in 1782 could have 
seen in his mind’s eye the potentialities of steam, the 
expansion and the development of colonies, the up-grewth 
of the Factory System, the discovery of Bessemer steel, 
and of multitudinous inventions multiplying infinitel 
the resources of human labour, to what level would suc 
a gifted man have guessed that general prices must fall? 

To one-half? Certainly. 

To one-quarter? Not improbably. 

General prices now, in 1895, as gauged at 
figures, stand at 44 per cent. of the 1782 initia 
Not unnatural! Barely lower than half. o 

Suppose the value of one year’s produce of Europe in 
1782 (or a given quantity) was £1,000,000,000. 

In 1789 the same was worth £850,000,000, an annual 
“loss ” of £150,000,000 within 7 years’ time. 

In 1809 the same was worth £1,570,000,000. 

How on earth did prices rise so extravagantly against 
all reasonable anticipation ? 

Simply because the Napoleonic campaign broke open

African gold is likely, I think certain, to do (approxi-

This, then, in my judgment is the practical conclusion 
of the whole matter. 

We are now in the depths of the valley between the 
mountain of the past, and the high hill of the future.

covering an area of about 24 acres, giving 1,800 feet on 
the line of the reef, and forming a property known 
as Bayley’s No. 2 South. The leases have been worked 
for a considerable time, and are described as being in an 
advanced state of development. Two shafts have been 
sunk to depths of about 82 and 30 feet, and drives north 
and south have been put out about 40 and 20 feet 
respectively. The purchase price has been fixed at 
£80,000, payable as to £20,000 in cash, £33,000 in shares, 
and the balance in cash or shares at the option of the 
directors.

issue of £100,000 in 5 per Cent. First Mortgage Deben- 
tures is offered by this company, the share capital 
amounting to £150,000, having been taken by the vendor 
company and the directors. The undertaking is to be 
taken over as a going concern, the new capital being 
required for constructing a large graving dock in connec- 
tion with the pontoon dock, which has been at work with 
successful results since January, 1893. The directors 
express their belief that full work will be found for the 
new dock when completed. 


Gloucester Corporation Three per Cent. Redeemable

authorised by the Corporation of the City of Gloucester 


to receive tenders for £158,000 of 3 per cent. Redeemable

| The loan is required to redeem existing loans bearing a 


higher rate of interest, and for other purposes. The 
population of Gloucester in 1891 was 39,239, and its rate- 
able value is stated to be £154,053. 


McKenzie Gold Mines (L.).—This company has been 
formed, with a capital of £75,000, in £1 shares, for the 
purpose of acquiring and working 15 acres of gold- 
bearing lands, described in the reports as being highly 
auriferous, situated in the White Feather district of the 
Coolgardie Gold-fieids, Western Australia. It is stated 
that large quantities of gold have already been taken 
from alluvial workings on the course of the reefs, and Mr 
W. Clarke, the manager of the White Feather Reward 
Claim, cables that *‘ crushings from the reef will average 
4 ounces of gold to the ton.” The purchase considera- 
tion has been fixed by the vendors, the Western 
Australian Development Corporation, at £60,000, payable 
as to £20,000 in cash, and the balance in fully-paid shares.

law, and holds a concession granted by the South African 
Republic (the Transvaal) for the construction and working 
of a railway, now being built, from a point between 
Komati-brug and Nelspruit to the District of Selati. 
The present issue consists of bearer certificates relating 
to 15,000 shares (part of 25,000 shares, which constitute 
the capital of the company) of 500 francs each. They are 
offered at £18 each, or about 903 per cent. The South 
African Republic guarantees the company a minimum 
dividend of 4 per cent. on its fully-paid capital, and has 
already made payment to the end of 1893.

reserve had received a substantial augmentation, and stood at over 


nineteen millions. The position in the United States, however, was 
giving rise to some disquietude, as the Treasury, in consequence of 
the continued export of gold, had been compelled to borrow from 
the banks in order to maintain its reserve. On the Stock Exchange 
the tone was depressed generally, the rates dispute having an 
adverse influ ence in the Home railway market, and American rails 
were under the influence of the collapse of the Philadelphia and 
Reading, which had passed under a receivership. The Peruvian 


Corporation announced the terms of settlement agreed to by the 
Chilian Government. 


In 1891, at the corresponding period, the Bank rate was reduced 
to its present level of 2 per cent., and at the same time the Bank 
made use of the power it had acquired to increase its fiducia 
issue by £350,000. The market rate for three months’ bills h 
fallen to 1} per cent., and there was a pretty general anticipation 
of the long spell of cheap money which has actually been 
experienced. There was no feature of importance in Stock

The remittances disposed of during the week ending 
February 19th were for Rs.13,100,000, and realised £698,794, ' 
while from April 1, 1894, to the same date Rs.265,002,431 
were allotted in bills and telegraphic transfers, the amount 
received being £14,477,754. 

Tenders for the issue of £218,000 Staffordshire County 
3 per cent. stock were opened on 22nd inst. at Lloyds Bank, 
Limited, and amounted to £937,690, at prices varying from 
the minimum of £103 to £106. Tenders at £103 14s will 
receive about 20 per cent. of the amount applied for, and 
those above that price in full. The average price obtained 
for the stock is £103 19s. 

Tenders will be received at the Chief Cashier’s office, at 
the Bank of England, on Monday, the 25th instant, at one 
o’clock, for Treasury bills to the amount of £1,000,000. The 
bills will be in amounts of £1,000, £5,000, or £10,000. They 
will be dated the 2nd March, 1895, and will be payable at 
three months, or six months, or twelve months, after date 
(at the option of the persons tendering), viz, on June 2nd 
or September 2nd next, or March 2, 1896, respectively. The 


have also hardened, day-to-day terms being 1 to 1} per 
cent., and seven-day loans 13 per cent. The discount houses 
on Thursday decided to raise their allowance on deposits 
at seven days’ notice to ? per cent., the rate on money at call 
and bank deposits remaining unchanged at } per cent. The 
only feature in the week’s Bank return is the transference of 
funds due to the tax collections, which is shown in an 
increase of £1,448,191 in the public deposits, and a decrease 
of £718,287 in other deposits. The Bank’s stock of gold has 
been augmented by £458,323, of which £53,000 came in from 
abroad, leaving £405,000 as the reduction in the home cir- 
culation. There was also a contraction of £96,725 in the 
circulation of notes, and the Bank reserve was consequently 
swollen to the extent of £555,000, making the total 
£29,673,000. The proportion of reserve to liabilities has 
risen } to 703 per cent.

week of last t year, while the desrease of £10,235) o2 ths Ss053h lines 
is equal to 7:2 per cent. 

The aggregate totals show on the English and [risk linss a de- 
crease of £524,561, equal to 66 per cent., and on the Scotch lines 
a Gecrease of £:6,891, equal to 4-0 per cent., as compared with the 
corresponding period of 1593. 


Foreign Government Securities.—The Foreiga market has 
been undecided in tone, and the variations in the principal 
international securities are consequently irregular. German, 
Italian, and Austrian Rentes show more or less im- 
provement on balance, and Greeks also exhibit some 
improvement. The fears of some imbroglio in Egypt, 
however, owing to the impatience of the Khedive under 
the British tutelage, have caused som: selling of 
Egyptians and Turkish Tribute bonds, taough the fall so 
caused does not amount in any case to as much as 1 per 
cent. French Rentes have slightly declined. In the 
South American department, Argentines are down again, as 
the gold premium shows a rising tendency, and evidence is 
lacking that any reform in the government of the country 
is likely to ensue from the recent change of personvel. 
Uruguays have also shown further weaknes3, having shed 
an additionai 1} during the week. The issue of Treasury 
bonds, although not directly affscting the security of the 
bondholders, is held to disclose a weak financial situation. 
Brazilians have steadily improved on a rising exchange, 
Western of Minas bonds being in considerable request at 
about 81, which is as high as they have gone recently, but 
still gives a return of about 6} per cant. Mo2xicans and 
(Peruvians advanced early in the week, but are duil at the 
<lose.

American Railways.—Railroad securities are not likely 
‘to receive much notice until the Government bond issue 
is well out of hand. If that should result in a restoration 
of confidence, and a more Sainanconeenmchontdes see sn ac a A kA NN PE ARMOR ENN CEO development of the business 


revival, then perhaps railway stocks might get another 
turn. In addition to that large “if,” however, there are 
the reorganisations to be accomplished, so that altogether 
the prospects of a recovery on anything like a general scale 
still appear remote. The movements this week are nearly all 
dowaward, but are almost confined to shares of a few bank- 
rupt roads. Atchisons are lower all round, and Erie Common 
and Preferred, and Norfolk Preferred have each declined 
sharply. Erie bonds hava also lost 2 or 3 points, but else- 
where the changes are trifling.

Coiouial and Foreign Riilways.—Without any apparent 
change for the better in prospects—the cabled summary of 
the Grand Trunk report being, in fact, about as gloomy as 
possible—a more cheerful tone has prevailed in the Colonial 
Railway market. Canadian Pacific shares hive remained 
steady, while the Debenture bonds and stocks have been 
bought rather extensively, and are up 1 to 2 points. 
Trunks have experienced rather a decided rally, the 
week's trafli: decrease not being sufficient to give 
much encouragement tothe bears. The interest attracted 
recently by Indian railway stocks appears to have 
died out, the only change this week beinga rise of } in East 
Indian “B” Annuities. Mexicans, in spite of some 
recovery towards the close, are lower on the week. Argen- 
tines, Brazilians, and Uruguays are generally somewhat 
lower, though there are advances in the case of one or two 
Preference and D2benture stocks.

Mines, &.—A sisi deal of irregularity has been dis- 
played by the Mining market during the past week. At 
times prices have moved up sharply, at others they have 
fallen, with as little apparent reason as for the advances. 
The near approach of tne settlement, which begins in 
mines on Monday, has caused a restriction of buying 
operations, and, lacking fresh support, some of the high- 
priced shares, such as Rand Mines, Sim mer and Jack, 
Modderfontein, and Langlaagte, have given way. Mr 
Hamilton Smith’s very temperate report on the Rand 
industry has not told in favour of operators for 
the rise; but, as a rule, the declines have not been 
serious, and in a few instances an improvement 
has taken place on balance. The so-called “ Barnato” shares 
are generally lowsr, though Glenc airns have risen on 

deal” in 40,000 shares in one line. The lower-priced 
issues have been flatin tendency. Diamond shares have 
been buoyant, though the best prices have not been fully 
maintained. Jagersfonteins hav been up to nearly 20, on 
the splitting arrangement, and rumours of an increased 
dividend. Lind and Exploration shares have been dull,

A good many provincial Brewery shares have improved in

ment, and the alarmist manifestoes issued by the companies 
Gas stocks have not moved this 
week. Salt Union have declined, and Nitrates are lower. 
Brunner Monds have also eased off on the declaration of a

THE CORN TRADE. 


Mark Lane, Friday Evening. 

The intense and prolonged frost has at length broken, and there 
have in the course of the present weck been occasionally several 
degrees of thaw. It has not been at all rapid, which, as regards the 
crops, is not unfavourable. So long as their protective covering of 
snow continues the position is safe, and the longer it continues, 
the less will be the danger of a return of frost to any 
serious extent. Meantime, the ice blockage on the canals 
and rivers is relapsing, though very slowly, and movement of 
supplies is becoming less difficult. Bub notwithstanding the in- 
creased consumption of breadstuffs and dry feed which must have 


arisen from the protracted check vegetation has received, the 
demand does not improve, and the spot trade throughout the 
country is still dull, with market rates tending to be called firm. 
The cause is mainly to be attributed to the continued movement of 
supplies from the interior to the seaboard of American, and the 
liberal extent of shipments. The American visible supply 18 
10,290,000 quarters, against 9,932,500 quarters last year at this 
date. The quantity of wheat and flour afloat for the United 
Kingdom is estimated as 3,315,0COqra, against 2,794,000 qrs last 
year, which with the addition of the supplies on the way for the 
Continent brings the total for Europe up to 4,112,000 qrs, against 
3,759,0U0 qrs at the corresponding date last year. Owing to the 
very limited spot business at Mark Lane, prices are hardly altered 
quotably. In the floating and forward shipment trades only small 
sales have been effected, and with very little change in values. 
La Plata, February-March shipment, has been sold at 2Is 3d for 
fair average quality, and for ditto, March-April. 2!s bid. Entre 
Rios, similar despatch, obtained like bids. For Californian, 23s 6d 
bid for prompt shipment, and 25s asked. South Australian, afloat, 
has been sold at 23s 9d, and for ditto, off coast, 23s 74d bid. A 
small trade done in parcels, including hard Manitoba, February- 
March shipment, at 23s 74d and 23s 9d. Indian wheats firm, but 
slow. Russian inactive, and generally held above relative 
market value. Barley on the spot is not quotably altered 
either in the provincial markets or at Mark Lane, and for arriv 
also the trade is slow. Novorossisk for shipment by vessel due out 
2ist inst., 12s 44d, Continent paid, and ditto afloat sold, 12s 6d; 
Sebastopol afloat sold, 12s 6d. For Talcia shipping or shipped, 
12s Gd refused. For Kustendje, Feb..March, 12s 74d is 
said to have been obtainable, and that price is Te 
— paid for shipment by vessel due out. Maize has sold dearer, 
ut is quiet at previous value here. The forward shipment mar 
has been fairly firm, Galatz-Foxanian, old an shipping or shipped, 
sold at 20s 104d, and subsequently at 21s 14d. For old Danubian, 
loading, 203 103d refused. Odessa parcels, afloat, sold 20s 8, 
and Bombay, for shipment by vessel, due ovt 2Ist inst., sold & 
20s 6d. Poti, prompt, done at 19s 6d, and now shipping 
19s 3d. American parcels, done at 18s 44d, arrived, 5

THE IRON AND COAL TRADES. 





There is an improving tone generally inthe iron and steel trades 
and manufacturers are getting more unwilling to Co business at 
recent low rates. The Glasgow warrant market bas had a quiet 
tendency with small business. Prices have remained steady, and 
show but little change on the week. Closing quotations are as 
follows :— Buyers, 41s 44d; cash, 413 64d; one month sellers 3d 
more. 

Our Middlesbro’ correspondent writing on Thursday says :—There 
exists now a better tone in the market for Cleveland pig-iron in con- 
sequence of a revived demand, especially for foreign shipment. The 
business done this week has not been large, because iron-masters 
remain firm in their demands for somewhat higher prices for later 
delivery. To-day’s quotations are No. 3 34s 6d, No. 4 33s 6d for 
prompt, and 6d more for spring delivery. Hematite iron does not 
sell well on account of the unsatisfactory state of the steel trade. 
Bessemer 41s 6d. This also depresses hematite ore prices, of which 
tke sale is ditficult even at 11s ¢d for best Rubio. 

The finished iron and steel trades are slightly firmer in tone, 
but have scarcely got into swing since the stoppage due to the 
frost. 

In the North of England quotations are piven ag follows :—- 
Iron ship-plates, £4 15s per ton; stecl ship-plates, £4 12s 6d; 
steel and iron angles, £t 103; common bars, £4 lis per ton, 
all less 24 per cent., f.o.t. Steel rails, £3 1283 6d net at works. 
The coal trade continues fairly satisfactory, the demand for house 
fuel being specially well maintained. Steam coal at Newcastle is, 
however, slightly lower in price, best being quoted 8s 9d per ton 
f.o.b., and small 33s 3d to 33 9d. In Lancashire the demand is 
princ:pally for house coal and deliveries over the canals. Prices 
remain steady at from 10s 6d to 11s for best Wigan Arley, 93 6d to 
103 for Pemberton 4-feet and seconds Arley, 7s 6d to 8s for common 
house coal, and 63 6d to 7s for steam and forge qualities at the pit 
mouth. On the London Exchange only small quantities of sea- 
borne coalare as yet available. ()uotations are, Hetton Wallsend, 


17s Ay ; Hetton Lyons, 16s 6d; and North Staffordshire medium is 
7s 6d. 


Writing from Cardiff on February 21st respecting the South | 


Wales coal trade, our correspondent says :--The shipments of coal 
during the last week shcw again a considerabie decrease as against 
the usual weekly average. “iw collieries have had to suspend 
work owing to the scarcity of tonnage in the port. Now that the thaw 
and milder weather has set in steamers are getting more plentiful, 
and next week it is expected that stems will be very heavy. Prices 
remain unaltered, but dry coals have advanced owing to the 
increased demand in the French market, where this description of 
coal is used extensively for household purposes, Small steam coal 
has also advanced in price. To-day best qualities of steam coal are 
quoted at 103 6d to 103 9d; second qualities, $s 94 to 10s 3d; dry 
coals, 9s 6d to 93 94; small steam, 5s to 5s 6d. Outward freights 
|} have further advanced, especially for Mediterranean ports. 





THE COTTON TRADE. 


LIVERPOOL, February 21.

the latter part of the week, and a fair business has resulted at firm 
prices. Sea Island has been in limited request. The quotations of

the market was quiet in the early part of the week, but yesterday 
the demand improved, and a an business has been done at 
steady rates, the quotations showing 1-32d per lb advance. In 
Brazilian a fair business has been done, and last week's quotations 
are resumed. Egyptian has been in good demand at firm rates. 
In rough Peruvian a small business has been done at unchanged 

rices ; moderately-rough sorts have been neglected. Smooth has

spinners cared to entertain. Bolton counts difficult to sell -

trade, a lessened production is inevitable. Cloth still retains - 
steadier position of the two departments. The eres ve 
exchange has enabled more India orders to be concluded, mostly io 
shirtings for Calcutta, and mulls, bleaching jacconets, and aos 
miscellaneous goods for Bombay and Kurrachee. China deman 
has lessened, and nothing of weight can be recorded for — 
The minor foreign outlets are all reported as quieter, as buyers have 
little confidence to act during the present uncertainty. Home 
trade buying continues of a moderate description, but more has

Mis:ellaneous.— Bank shares have moved irregularly, but 
in one or two cases a heavy fall is shown, due to the | 
publication of more or less discouraging reports by the | 
banks. Thus, Bank of British North America shares have 
fallen 4}, to 54, though this does not represent such 
a depreciation as the fall of 2 in International of London, 


only is} 


Brazilian, and London and San Francisco have improved. 


A good many provincial Brewery shares have improved in 
price, but the American companies continue to fall away. A 
feature of the week’s business in miscellaneous issues is a 
heavy fall in the stocks of the London water companies, 
due to the action of the London County Council in Parlia- 
ment, and the alarmist manifestoes issued by the companies 
in reference to the Bills. Gas stocks have not moved this 
week. Salt Union have declined, and Nitrates are lower. 
Brunner Monds have also eased off on the declaration of a 
30 per cent. dividend, which perhaps appears unsatisfactory 
to people who got 100 per cent. eighteen months ago.

confidence. Beet is, however, maintained at former quotations, 
and the sales to refiners continue small. The stock in Ham 
shows a very important increase upon that of last year, an

THE CORN TRADE. 


Mark Lane, Friday Evening. 

The intense and prolonged frost has at length broken, and there 
have in the course of the present week been occasionally several 
degrees of thaw. It has not been at all rapid, which, as regards the 
crops, is not unfavourable, So long as their protective covering of 
snow continues the position is safe, and the longer it continues, 
the less will be the danger of a return of frost to any 
serious extent. Meantime, the ice blockage on the canals 
and rivers is relapsing, though very slowly, and movement of 
supplies is becoming less difficult. Bub notwithstanding the in- 
creased consumption of breadstufis and dry feed which must have 


arisen from the protracted check vegetation has received, the 
demand does not improve, and the spot trade throughout the 
country is still dull, with market rates tending to be called firm. 
The cause is mainly to be attributed to the continued movement of 
supplies from the interior to the seaboard of American, and the 
liberal extent of shipments. The American visible supply is 
10,290,000 quarters, against 9,932,500 quarters last year at this 
date. The quantity of wheat and flour afloat for the United 
Kingdom is estimated as 3,315,0CO0 qr3, against 2,794,000 qrs last 
year, which with the addition of the supplies on the way for the 
Continent brings the total for Europe up to 4,112,000 qrs, against 
3,759,000 qra at the corresponding date last year. Owing to the 
very limited spot business at Mark Lane, prices are hardly altered 
quotably. In the floating and forward shipment trades only small 
sales have been effected, and with very little change in values. 
La Plata, February-March shipment, has been sold at 2is 3d for 
fair average quality, and for ditto, March-April. 2!s bid. Entre 
Rios, similar despatch, obtained like bids. For Californian, 23s 6d 
bid for prompt shipment, and 25s asked. South Australian, afloat, 
has been sold at 23s 9d, and for ditto, off coast, 23s 74d bid. A 
small trade done in parcels, including hard Manitoba, February- 
March shipment, at 23s 74d and 23s 9d. Indian wheats firm, but 
slow. Russian inactive, and generally held above relative 
market value. Barley on the spot is not quotably altered 
either in the provincial markets or at Mark Lane, and for arrival 
also the trade is slow. Novorossisk for shipment by vessel due out 
21st inst., 12s 44d, Continent paid, and ditto afloat sold, 12s 6d; 
Sebastopol afloat sold, 12s 6d. For Talcia shipping or shipped, 
12s 6d refused. For Kustendje, Feb.-March, 12s 74d is 
said to have been obtainable, and that price is re- 
ported paid for shipment by vessel due out. Maize has sold dearer, 
but is quiet at previous value here. The forward shipment market 
has been fairly firm, Galatz-Foxanian, old a shipping or shipped, 
sold at 20s 104d, and subsequently at 21s 13d. For old Danubian, 
loading, 203 10}d refused. Odessa parcels, afloat, sold 20s 34, 
and Bombay, for shipment by vessel, due out 21st inst., sold at 


20s 6d. Poti, prompt, done at 19s 6d, and now shipping ad / 


19s 3d. American parcels, done at 18s 43d, arrived, and 
18s 10}d, March shipment. On the spot, oats have been a quiet 
trade through the week, with very little change in value. Beans 
and peas unaltered.

THE IRON AND COAL TRADES. 





There is an improving tone generally in the iron and steel trades 
and manufacturers are getting more unwilling to Co business at 
recent low rates. The Glasgow warrant market bas had a quiet 
tendency with small business. Prices bave remained steady, and 
show but little change on the week. Closing quotations are as 
follows :— Buyers, 41s 44d; cash, 41s 64d; one month sellers 4d 
more. 

Our Middlesbro’ correspondent writing on Thursday says :—There 
exists now a better tone in the market for Cleveland pig-iron in con- 
sequence of a revived demand, especially for foreign shipment. The 
business done this week has not been large, because iron-masters 
remain firm in their demands for somewhat higher prices for later 
delivery. To-day’s quotations are No. 3 34s 6d, No. 4 33s 6d for 
prompt, and 6d more for spring delivery. Hematite iron does not 
sell well on account of the unsatisfactory state of the steel trade. 
Bessemer 41s 6d. This also depresses hematite ore prices, of which 
the sale is ditficult even at 1ls ¥d for best Rubio. 

The finished iron and steel trades are slightly firmer in tone, 
but have scarcely got into swing since the stoppage due to the 
frost. 

In the North of England quotations are riven as follows :—- 
Iron ship-plates, £4 15s per ton; steel ship-plates, £4 12s 6d; 
steel and iron angles, £t 10s; common bars, £4 lis per ton, 
all less 25 per cent., f.o.t. Steel rails, £3 123 6d net at works. 
The coal trade continues fairly satisfactory, the demand for house 
fuel being specially well maintained. Steam coal at Newcastle is, 
however, slightly lower in price, best being quoted 8s 9d per ton 
f.o.b., and smal! 33 3d to 33 9d. In Lancashire the demand is 
principally for house coal and deliveries over the canals. Prices 
remain steady at from 10s 6d to 11s for best Wigan Arley, 93 6d to 
103 for Pemberton 4-feet and seconds Arley, 7s 6d to 8s for common 
house coal, and 63 6d to 7s for steam and forge qualities at the pit 
mouth. On the London Exchange only small quantities of sea- 
borne coal are as yet available. Quotations are, Hetton Wallsend, 

7s 6d ; Hetton Lyons, 16s 6d; and North Staffordshire medium is 

| 7s 6d. 


Writing from Cardiff on February 2ist respecting the South | 


Wales coal trade, our correspondent says :--The shipments of coal 
during the last week shcw again a considerabie decrease as against 
the usual weekly average. Many collieries have had to suspend 
work owing to the scarcity of tonnage in the port. Now that the thaw 
and milder weather has set in steamers are getting more plentiful, 
and next week it is expected that stems will be very heavy. Prices 
remain unaltered, but dry coals have advanced owing to the 
increased demand in the French market, where this description of 
coal is used extensively for household purposes, Small steam coal 
has also advanced in price. To-day best qualities of steam coal are 
quoted at 103 6d to 10s 9d; second qualities, $s 9d to 10s 3d; dry 
| coals, 9s 6d to 93 9d; small steam, 5s to 5s 6d. Outward freights 
have further advanced, especially for Mediterranean ports.

MANCHESTER, February 21. 

There is no perceptible change in our market since last waek. 
Affairs are practically unaltered, but Pong samen ae eee where 
sales are im tive, some irregulari ue ex enced. 
The oenttel Walinn of the market is that prices have already 
reached so low a level that it is questionable whether it is 
not better to stop machinery rather than accept business 
a reduction from existing rates. Inquiries for export yarns, 
though fairly numerous, have not often been at acceptable 
limits, and neither for the East nor a 
approaching an average trade gone through. 
turing counts prices are firm, in sympathy with the advance of

has lessened, and nothing of weight can be recorded for Japan. 
The minor foreign outlets are all reported as quieter, as buyers have 
little confidence to act during the present uncertainty. Home 
trade buying continues of a moderate description, but more has 
been done in plain heavy goods than of late. Coloured and fancy 
fabrics are still bad to sell.

THE LEATHER TRADE. 


The demand for leather during the past week has been of a very 
restricted and retail character. Prices show little variation. Owing 
to severe weather supplies of fresh leather have been small.

THE WOOL TRADE. 




































The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, 
Limited, have received a telegram from their branch at Christ- 
church respecting the New Zealand wool sales as follows: “ Of 
106,000 bales offered, 71,000 bales have been sold. The market is 
unchanged.” 

The wool markets continue very quiet. There is very little 
demand for English wools, and prices, consequently, are decidedly 
weak and irregular. 

Our Bradford correspondent, writing on Thursday, says:—A 
rather better demand for both wool and tops has been experienced 
since the recent sharp recovery in the Antwerp and HKoubaix 
markets. In merinos, which had been disproportionately lower 
than the stronger sorts, this has resulted in a fractional hardening 
in the price of sixties tops, but in the case of cross-bred and English 
wools the only outcome has been a good deal more business at the 
bottom prices. Exceptional or slaughtering rates are not now 
quoted, and holders who retused to accept these rates three weeks 
ago cannot now sell at any advance upon the prices they were 
then prepared to take. Values cannot, therefore, be said to have 
bardened, although they are very firm all round. Business in 
yarns and manufactured goods is steadily increasing in volume so 
far as the home trade is concerned, but prices are very depressed, 
and the export yarn trade is but indifferent. Mohair sold on 
Wednesday better than was anticipated, and the tone here is 
firmer. ‘ 





THE SILK TRADE. 





The public sales,.which commenced yesterday, were concluded 
to-day. Tbe attendance was not large, and the bidding only 
moderate. Prices ruled about the same as those last current. 


. 
; 


JUTE, HEMP, AND FLAX TRADE. 


The Jute market continues unsettled by prospective large supplies, 
Calcutta entries for shipment during the past fortnight amounting 
to 190,000 bales. Sales have continued small, amounting to about 
5,090 bales, including first marks at 210 to £10 1s 3d, February- 
March, at £10 to rather more for London, Trade in Dundee is 
disc »aging, and the stock of yarns increasing. American demand 
does not revive as anticipated.

468 bags Grenada went from 47s 6d to 50s; very good to fine, 51s 


at to 4d. By private contract, the demand is restricted to

COFFEE.— With the break up of the frost there will shortly bs a 
full supply. Public sales this week have been light, and fine 
qualities realised full to rather higher rates, including colory new 
crop Costa Rica. The Terminal market for Brazil is quiet, and 
prices have scarcely varied during the week. At auction, the 
supply of East India has not exceeded §23 bags, numerous parcels 
being in course of landing. Naidoobatum, small and low middling,

NOTES UPON INVESTMENTS 


THE UNITED STATES LOAN. 

For the third time within thirteen months the Government 
of the United States has found itself under the necessity of 
borrowing largely for the purpose of maintaining the 
Treasury reserve of gold. The loan issued during the past 
month is for upwards of £13,000,000, one-half of which was 
subscribed for in London. The issue here has been an 
enormous success, the amount having been applied for 18 
times over. The loan was quoted at a small premium as 
soon as the lists were opened, and this has since risen 
to 5 on theissue price of 1134, or 118} per cent, It hasveen 
suggested that the bonds even at this price are still a 
cheap investment, the net return being about 34 per cent. 
whereas the bonds of the former. issues can be bought to 
return only 2? per cent. This contention, however, over- 
looks the fact that the two classes of bonds differ 
emai in character. The emissions of Feoruary and 
December, 1894, were issued under the same conditions as 
previous loans, which had always been repaid in gold 
and these could not, therefore, without an act o 
virtual repudiation, be repaid on any other basis. 
The difference in regard | tothe 1895 loan is that the lenders 
first objected to a “coin” bond, asking for an ex 
stipulation that repayment should be in gold. This, how- 
ever, the United States Legislature could not be induced to 
sanction, and a higher rate of interest was demanded and 
allowed on account of the absence of a definition of the 
word “coin” as geld. It is clear, therefore, that no 
should « of breach of faith can arise if the United States 

ould at any time exercise the option so — accorded 

ying the bonds off in silver instead = pelt That 

such a course will be taken may be doubtful, but the possi- 
bility that it might be done without any reflection upon the 
honour or credit of the American Government should not 
be overlooked.

Ox feature of business during’ the pas ‘month was a 


somewhat s ic rise in silver and silver securities, 
brought about through speculation induced by the statement 
made in the German Reichstag by Prince Hohenlohe, the 
German Chancellor. This has been hailed. by the 
bi-metallists as affording an indication of the gradual 
conversion of the German Government to their views. 
That, however, is quite a mistaken idea, as the 
statement was a most carefully-guarded one, its opening 
sentence declaring that whatever followed was to 
be taken as in no way prejudicing the present. Imperial 
currency system. No doubt capital will be made out of the 
debate in our own Parliament on bi-metallism on Tuesday 
of the present week. But here, again, the Chancellor of the 
Exchequer, while agreeing to the proposal of a conference, 
was very explicit in stating that it did not commit the 
Government in any way to an agreement with the principle 
of bi-metallism. On the contrary, he made it clear that the 
Government would stand by the currency, which he 
regarded as one of the greatest securities of the Empire. 
In fact, all that either Government has agreed to 
is that there is no harm in a number of delegates 
meeting to talk over the subject again if the Powers 
think well. Another conference the bi-metallists may 
possibly succeed in bringing about, but there is not the 
slightest prospect of its being in any degree more productive 
of a tangible result than its predecessors have been. Of far 
more hope for a partial rehabilitation of silver is 
the position in the East. The war between Japan 
and China must come to a _ termination sooner or 
later, and one of its results will almost certainly be the 
opening up of China, with its vast area of territory and 
population, to foreign trade. That would mean a great 
absorption of silver as a medium of exchange. Japan, too, 
would find employment for large quantities of the white 
metal, as itis unlikely, after the strain her resources have 
undergone from the demands of the conflict she has waged, 
that she will be able to make any progress with schemes 
having for their object the establishment of a gold 
standard in Japan. 








THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN GOLD INDUSTRY. 


Tue latest news from Western Australia shows that in many 
of the gold-mining districts substantial progress has been 
made with the work of development and exploration, not- 
withstanding the difficulties incidental to preliminary 
operations of the kind, and the special difficulties with 
which the pioneers in this particular colony are confronted. 
According to the Australian Mail, the yield of the precious 
metal in 1886 was only 302 ounces, in the following year it 
was 4,073 ounces, and in 1888, 3,493 ounces. Since then the 
annual production has been as follows :—

It is intéresting to observe that in the past year the pro- 
duction has increased quarter by quarter; from 35,368 
ounces in the first three months to 40,450 ounces in the 
second, and from 62,846 ounces in the third quarter to 
67,567 ounces in the fourth. Sofar, however, the companies 
formed on this side have contributed but little to the total, 
and Bayley’s Reward, which, though a local company, has 
been extensively supported on this side by purchases of the 
shares up to 25s, has apparently exhausted its supply of rich 
ore. This company used to get 700 ounces of gold a week 
from 70 tons of ore or less; it is now getting 200 ounces 
from 150 tons, and it is impossible to say how long even the 
diminished return will last, It is not to be wondered at, 
therefore, that the promised Westralian “ boom” hangs fire, 
and that prices have receded on balance since the end of 
last year, even the Prpmenins concerns suffering slightly 
though one or two of them have still large blocks of lan 
waiting to be sold off to sub-companies. The following 
table shows the changes in the leading shares in the past 
two months :— ;

Meanwhile the promoting and underwriting fraternity have 
been busily engaged inviting the public to purchase Western 
Australian properties, the total amount asked for up to date 
being between £7,500,000 and £8,000,000. It is imp ssible 
to say at present what amount of capital has actually been 
subscribed ; but it is known that many of the ventures were 
unsuccessful in getting sufficient money to proceed to allot- 
ment, and that in many cases also, where allotment was 
made, it was on a very small proportion of the capita) 
There are exceptions, of course ; but as a general rule the 
companies offered have been over-capitalised on the one 
hand ; while, on the other, the provision of working capital 
has been much too small. If Western Australia is to rival 
the Rand it will be upon a very different basis to that of 
most of the companies introduced on this side, where in the 
event of profits being realised, from 70 to 80 per cent. of them 
would go to the vendors or to those who relieve them oi 
their shares. 





RAND MINING SHARES. 


In the last issue of the MANUAL we referred to the decline 
which had taken place in the principal Rand mining shares 
during the second half of the month. The “boom,” which 
had continued in full swing up tothe close of last year, had 
quieted down, owing to the large and almost continuous 
realisations by speculators, who thought it prudent to secure 
their profits. There was also a certain amount of “ loss- 
cutting” by operators who came into the market at about 
the highest level of prices. Very much thé same condition 
of things existed for the first half of the past month, the 
decrease in the aggregate production of gold for January, 
though largely explainable by temporary causes, helping 
the downward movement. Since the middle of the month, 
however, there has been a pretty general recovery in Rand 
shares, and in several instances quotations have risen 
beyond the range ruling at the close of last year. This has 
been especially the case in the shares which are largely held 
on the Continent, such as Ferreira, Glencairn, Jubilee, 
Orion, Rand Mines, Van Ryn and Wemmer, as will be seen 
from the follewing comparison of prices at the dates 
specified :—

Perhaps the most conspicuous feature in the recent move 
ments.of Rand shares has been the insreased speculation 2 
deep-level shares. As we have pointed out more than once, 
the value of the deep-level properties is at present 4D 
unknown guantity. The only experience obtained - 
actual working has been in the Village Main Reef oo 
Creesus Deep properties, and, as in both those instances a 
batteries have had to be shut down, pending the mor 
extensive development of the properties, it can scarcely ah 
suggested that the results thus far obtained have been de oe 
as to encourage very sanguine expectations. And yet en be 
level shares, as a whole, stand at very high prices, as

No doubt the high prices of Rand Mines, Goldfields Deep, 
and Geldenhuis Deep shares are based upon the anticipation 
‘that large portions of the areas of the several companies 
will be taken over by ‘the subsidiary companies ; but the 
guccessful flotation of such companies in the future will 
depend, to some extent at least, on the results which may be 
obtained by the existing deep-level ventures. We are far 
from suggesting that the results will not be satisfactory. 
fhe whole business has, however, to be proved. Meanwhile, 
investors who feel inclined to go in for deep-level shares 
should before doing so read the éxtremely able report on 
the Rand industry as a whole which Mr Hamilton Smith, 
the well-known expert, contributed to The Times of 
February .1y9th. 





THE TWO CANADIAN RAILWAYS. 


Tne decision of the directors of the Canadian Pacific 
Railroad to “‘ pass” the dividend for the second half of last 
yeat has naturally led to a heavy fall in the prices of the 
shares, for although few expected that 5 per cent. would be 
distributed, not many thought that the half-year would be 
altegether barren. for the first half of the year a dividend 
was paid at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, so that in all 
the shareholders will get 23 per cent. for 1894, which repre- 
sents $1,625,000, but this is considerably more than the 
company earned. The revenue-statements for the eleven 
months ended November 30th showed that the net receipts 
had fallen off by $1,326,000, which sum was probably 
augmented iii December. At the same time, the can charges 
werelarger by about $250,000, owing tothe issue of preferred 
stock. However, it is evident that the net revenue, which 
amounted to $2,612,000 in 1893, must have fallen 
short of the amount distributed for the first half of the 
ear. Still, we have to remember that the company has a 
nd, representing accumulated surplus profits, which 
amounted at the end of 1593 to $7,261,000, and from this 
not more, apparently, than about $600,000 has been taken on 
aceount of 1894. Nevertheless, this fund was expressly said 
te be brought into existence for the sake of equalising divi- 
dends. We do not intend to criticise the directors for not 
making larger use of this fund, which we must. assume to be 
actual, and not as shadowy as American railway surpluses ; 
for, although the past year was a period of exceptional 
difficulty, the future is very far indeed from offering much 
“recompense of reward.” Yet they certainly erred in the 
a by the expression of unduly sanguine beliefs in the 
uture. For instance, in the report for 1891, the 
directors said that they believed that “the sur- 
plus earnings for the present year and_ hereafter 
will be at least sufficient to pay regular dividends at the 
rate of 5 per cent. per annum on the ordinary shares of the 
company.” Again, in the report for 1893 they said that, 
despite the depression in trade aud the bad outlook, the 
company had been able to make “ample provision,” and 
waa, therefore, “in a position to withstand a long period of 
depression, if need be, without inconvenience.” These 
temarks, it must be admitted, we think, were far too 
optimistic, although, at the same time, we freely admit that 
no one could have foreseen the excessive difficulties of 1894. 
he report for 1894 will be awaited with much interest, and 
Wwe hope that the directors, whilst justifying their actions, 
Will be able to show that their reserve fund has a real 
existence—does not, in fact, live merelyon paper. In the 
meantime, shareholders, we think, will do well not to throw 
away their shares in a fright at the present extremely low 
— but would rather suggest that the future should 
awaited, and this we think may be done with a fair 
degree of confidence.

been borrowed and the interest paid, so that for the present 
there is no danger of a receivership; but since the begin- 
ning of the year the recei have fallen off heavily, and 
this fact affords ground for alarm—alarm which is 
reflected in the heavy fall recorded in Grand Trunk 
stocks. However, just as the dead past should bu 
its dead, so it is mere vanity to attempt to | 
with too much confidence to the future of such 
undertakings as the Grand Trunk. But there are some 
points upon which we may be fairly certain. For instance, 
the Grand Trunk has been slipping back year after a 
and 1894 did but increase the rate of retrogression. How- 
ever, in view of what the —— now succeeds in doing, we 
may hold reasonably that the Preterence stocks are practically 
worthless, so far as dividends are concerned. This is how 
they stand in this respect :— 


£ 
To make up loss on 1894......0.........00005 141,200 
To pay guaranteed dividend ............... 208,792 
349,992 
To pay First Preference dividend......... 171,000

To pay Second Preference dividend ....., 126,500 
647,492 
To pay Third Preference dividend ......... 286,720 
934,212 


We cannot but think that the Guaranteed stock now 
virtually occupies the place of an ordinary stock, that is, in 
good years it will receive a dividend up to as much as the 
regulation 4 per cent. ; but that in bad years it will receive 
littleor nothing. It is very doubtful if a penny will ever 
be paid again on the First Preference, and, therefore, the 
subsequent issues are no better than gambling counters or 
voting tickets. If the public choose to regard them in this 
light, all well and good, but they should not be misled, and 
think that Grand Trunk Preference are any better than 
“Yankee” shares. As a matter of fact they are all ofa 
muchness, and for the excellent reason that they have been 
issued by companies which have passed through much the 
same experience, exist in much the same condition, and 
have a very similar future. 





TRAMWAY AND OMNIBUS COMPANIES IN 1894. 


The tramway and omnibus companies have now issued 
their accounts for the last six months of 1894, and we are 
thus enabled to present a comparison of the results obtained 
for the whole year, as compared with previous years. 
Carried back for five years, the comparison of dividend 
distributions is as follows :—

No general conclusion can be drawn from this comparison 
as to whether the year was better or worse for tramway 
shareholders than its predecessor, since out of the twenty- 
two companies enumerated above ten paid at the same rate 
as in 1893, six were able to pay increased dividends, and six 
made smaller distributions than in the previous year. It 
is needless to point out, however, that the climatic condi- 
tions in 1894 were much less favourable to travelling— 
especially as regards “ outside” passengers—than in the 
fine spring and summer of 1893. Where larger dividends 
have been paid, therefore, it has not been in consequence 
of increased gross receipts. but by means of savings in work- 
ing expenditure. That saving, too, was usually effected in 
the price of forage, from the fall in which the companies 
obtained great advantage last year, as compared with 1893. 
This is exemplitied by the fact that the London Road Car

Com , while it carried nearly a million fewer pas 
in the ls last half of the year, was able to pay a dividend at 
the rete of 6 per cent. annum, as compared with only 23 
cent. per annum for the f ng period of 1893. 
The London Tramways Company’s increase of dividend was 
entirely in the last half of the year, being at the rate of 12 
per cent., compared with 10 per cent. for the December half 
of 1893, The result was again mainly due to the low cost of 
forage. The lower divid ends have been declared in all 
one case by provincial undertakings. ‘Lhe Gionpor 

and thport companies each paid smaller dividends 
for some years previously. As regards Glasgow, this was 
due to the smaller scope of the business, as, the municipality 
having taken over the tramways, the company has now to 
depend for its receipts almost entirely upon its omnibus 








ENGLISH RAILWAYS IN THE PAST HALF-YEAR. 


(Abridged from the Economist.) : 
In reviewing the results obtained by our a railway 
companies in the last six months of 1894, unusual difficulties 
of comparison present themselves, owing to the disorganisa- 
tion created in the corresponding period of 1893 by the great 
coal strike. A comparison with a more normal period is 
obtained by going back to the last half of 1892, but even in 
that case, the change in conditions, in the course of two 
years, is so great, that it is misleading to draw very minute 
conclusions. Looked at broadly, from the shareholder’s 
int, the results obtained in the half-year cannot be 
ed as satisfactory, since the average dividend on the 
ordinary stocks of the fifteen companies included in our 
survey was lower than in any corresponding half-year of 
which we have a record, excepting, of course, the disastrous 
six months ending December, 1893. For the whole year 
also the average dividend is lower than for many years past, 
with the same exception, though it is only a fraction below 
that for 1892. The comparison for seven years past is as 
follows :—

The diminution in average dividend, compared with the 
second half of 1892, was due not so much to a falling off in 
receipts as toa growth in working expenses and augmenta- 
tion of capital. As will be seen from the following state- 
ment, the additions to capital during the past year have 
been mainly in the form of ordinary stock, the growth of 
re-ordinary charges having been comparatively slight. 
The addition in the case of the Sheffield company 
arises solely from the fact that for the last half of 1893 the 
company was unable to meet its preference charges by the 
amount shown in the following table :—

The gross revenue for the half-year amounted to £34,527,773, 
an increase of £1,881,283 as compared with 1893. Of this 
sum £385,426 was absorbed in increased working expenses, 
leaving £1,495,857 for the augmentation of net revenue. 
Compared with 1892 there was a decline in gross receipts of 
£51,357, a growth in working expenses of £270,152, and a 

uent loss of net revenue amounting to £321,509, or 2 


percent. The ratio of expenditure to receipts was 54°6 per 











cent. in 1894, 56°5 per cent. in 1893, and 53°7 per :

To the total increase of revenue for the half-year, as com- 
pared with the latter half of 1893, the coaching traffic 
contributed £446,900; merchandise, £273,800; minerals, 
£968,000; and live stock, £38,800. If, however, the 
comparison is carried back to 1892, it is seen that an increase 
in passengers is more than offset by a decline in merchan- 
dise and minerals. The chief increase in working expenses 
isin wages, which amounted to £362,800 more than in the 
corresponding period of 1893. In rates and taxes there was 
an increase of £71,700, but, on the other hand, a saving of 
£209,600 was effected in the cost of feul. 





FINANCIAL RECORD OF THE MONTH, 


Tue prominent feature in the money and stock markets 
during the past month has been the issue of a loan of over 
13 millions by the United States Government, for the 
purpose of replenishing the Treasury gold reserve. One- 
half the amount was offered in London, and for this the 
applications were so large as to cause a greater tightness in 
the money market than has existed for some time past. 
Business on the Stock Exchange was also diverted to 
some extent from its ordinary channels, and has 
consequently been reduced in volume. Generally, the 
tendency of prices is upward, though in some instances de- 
posnes has existed owing to special circumstances. Thus 
igyptian and Turkish stocks were affected by antici- 
pations of an outbreak of fanaticism at Cairo, fostered 
by the Khedive’s dislike of the British control. Home rai!- 
ways have suffered from the long spell of wintry weather, 
and a sharp fall has occurred in London Water Companies 
stocks on the introduction of proposals in Parliament for 
the purchaseof the undertakings by the London County 
Council. The severe weather had a restrictive influence 
on transport and industrial operations generally, so that 
the symptoms of trade revival are not more pronounced 
than they were a monthago. It is anticipated, however, 
that with the approach of spring and the temporary restora- 
tion of confidence in the United States the conditions are 
favourable for a more rapid improvement. 

Money.—Rates have had a hardening tendency through- 
out the month, first on the anticipation that 0) 
would be withdrawn from this side for the replenish- 
ment of the United States Treasury reserve, and later 
on the actual issue of a moiety of the loan here. 
The subscriptions are said to have amounted to eighteen 
times the sum applied for, resulting in a considerable 
temporary lock-up of money in the Sans of preliminary

its. Further inroads on available supplies were made 
the transfer of funds in connection with large dividend 
MY sribations, and the gathering-in of the revenue. Of the 
sams recently withdrawn from the market, the larger portion 
will shortly become again available, but in the meantime 
rates have advanced considerably, the rise being gradual at 
the beginning of the month, but more decided towards the 
close. Best three months’ bills are not taken under 1% per 
cent., as compared with § per cent. at the beginning of the 
menth. Four and six months’ paper is, however, taken on 
same terms, indicating that rates are not expected to go 
much higher at present. Short loans have recently com- 
manded 1 to 1} per cent. in the open market, while 
asmall awount of business has gone to the Bank of England 
at 2 per cent. The Bank itself occupies a very strong 
ition, its reserve being, in fact, nearly two millions 
‘cher than it was at the end of January, and as the instal- 
ments of the gold required for shipment to the States are 
already provided for a considerable period ahead, it appears 
unlikely that the Bank’s stock will be subjected to any 
extensive depletion on that account. The official rate of 
discount, which has now stood at 2 per cent. for a complete 
year will probably, therefore, remain undisturbed for the 
present, as a larger withdrawal than seems likely to take 
place could be withstood without rendering an advance 
nevessary. The position of the bank, movement of rates, 
&e., during the month and at corresponding periods are 
shown in the following table :—

Consols, & :.—The issue of the United States loan at a price 
giving a net yield of about - per cent, and its attendant 
consequences in the raising of discount and loan rates has 
naturally caused some depression in the Consols market. 
The fall, however, is not very excessive, and does not go 
re ag the most readily marketable securities, such as Con- 
sols, Two and a-Half per Cents. Local Loansand Metropolitan 
stocks, other first-class securities, such as Corporation stocks 
and railway debentures, remaining steady. The smaller issues 
of British Corporation securities are, as a rule, higher, 
the demand for these being mainly for permanent invest- 
ment purposes,and not as in any way an alternative to 
lending in the money market. Indian sterling loans bave 
maintained steadiness, but it may be noted that while the 
Three and a-Halfs have moved up } per cent. on balance, 
the Threes have declined to the same extent. Rupee Paper 
shows a distinct gain, the Indian exchanges having aeeatny 

dened, and a strong demand being apparent for 
India Council drafts. The recovery among Colonial stocks, 
noted last month, has made further progress, the demand 
shown being of a steady rather than a speculative character. 
All the Australasian stocks and Canadian and South African 
issues show an improvement ranging from } to 1 per cent., 
while in the case of Victorian Three and a-Half per Cent. 
Inscribed stock the gain extends to 3 pute That, however, 
ngs the quotation only to 99, while Queensland and New 
uth Wales stocks of the same denomination are quoted 
100 and 1014 respectively, and Cape of Good Hope Three 
and a-Halfs are valued at 1114. 
_ Briti-h Railways.—Dulness has been the prevailing feature 
in the Home railway market this month. The speeches at 
the half-yearly meetings were mostly of a deprecatory or 
peneto description and recent traffic results have not 
Nencouraging. Current returns, of course, compare with 
& period of partial inflation following the close of the great 
coal strike, while the long frost, from its restrictive influence 
on trade and travel generally, tended to reduce earnings. 
rom the almost complete stoppage it brought about in 
<r. transport, however, it must have had some effect in 

'verting traffic to the railways. However that may be, the 
ae antes returns are disappointing, inasmuchas they show 
th, °*8e8, not only as compared with last year, but with 

© previous year also. In most cases prices have fallen 
considerably in addition to the dividends deducted during 


month. Great Northerns show most weakness, owing, 
= rt to the heavy expenditure which is to be incurred 


reparations for meeting the competition of the Sheffield 
‘pany on the completion of its extension to London. The

prospects of the Sheffield undertaking itself are not regarded 
with favour in the market at present, asall class of the 
ordinary stocks have declined heavily as compared witha 
monthago. The latest preference stock, too, the Four per Cent. 


of 1891, has lost four points in addition to the dividend deduc- * 
tion. Great Eastern has been flat for the most part, and ° 


though somewhat firmer at the close, is about 14 down on 
the month, while Lancashire and Yorkshire has shed fully 
two points. The heavy stocks show more steadiness, quota- 
tions being equal to or slightly above last month’s. 
Southern lines have lost ground, theinclemency of the weather 
having seriously affected passenger receipts. Brighton 


The © 


issaes show most strength, but South-Eastern Deferred * 


has declined 2, while Little Chathams are 14 lower, and the 
Preferences 2 to 3. The Scotch stocks kave fluctuated con- 
siderably, but both the Deferred stocks are a full point 
lower on balance. 


Foreign Government Stocks.—The so-called International © 


stocks have received strong support from Paris during the 
greater part of the month, and despite the withdrawal of 


that support during the past few days and a sharp fall in © 
consequence, prices are in most instances well above those 
recorded at the end of January. Spanish and Italians have, ° 


as usual, taken the foremost place, the former having risen 
23 and latter 14, after being much higher. Nothing in the 
case of either country can be pointed to as warranting a 
rise in the value of their securities. Russians have moved 
up, a special advance being shown in the 1822 sterling loan. 
French, Austrian, and German stocks are each higher in 
price, and even Greeks and Portuguese have risen. The 
only downward movement in this department is in con- 
nection with Egyptian and Turkish stocks. This has 
occurred in consequence of a fresh stir-up in regard to the 


Khedive’s attitude towards his British counsellors, and it is - 


uite conceivable that too much has been made of it. The 
all in the stocks is not very pronounced, amounting to 
about a point each. Mexican stocks have exhibited a strong 
upward tendency, partly due to an improvement in the 
rice of silver, and partly to the favour accorded to the 
oe by German financiers. South American stocks 
generally are in betterdemand. Argentines, in consequence 
of a change of Presidents, which it is hoped may result in a 
stronger grasp of the reins of government. Brazilians on 
a rise in the Rio exchange, and Chilians, owing to the 
remoter probability of war with a neighbouring State. 
Uruguay bonds, on the other hand, have recently shown 
great weakness, first on the issue of internal Treasury bonds, 
amounting to two million dollars for the payment of salaries, 
anincident which disclosed the empty condition of the 
national exchequer, and latterly owing to disquieting reports 


respecting the trade situation at Montevideo, where a large | 


firm has failed, involving losses to some of the banks. 


American Railways.—The interest in American securities 
has been mainly directed to the bond issue of the G 
ment. In anticipation of allotments the bonds have been 
actively dealt in, at a premium rising at one time to 6 on 
the issue price. This has run off to some extent on the 
taking of profits a who expect to be among the for- 
tunate allottees. ilway stocks have in consequence been 
a good deal neglected, and the movements are of but little 
importance. e principal is in Norfolk Preferred, the 
Norfolk and Western property having gone into the hands 
of a receiver during the month. The bonds all show acorre- 
sponding fall., Erie shares and bonds have given way, asthe 
reorganisation seems to make little progress, and foreclosure 
is threatened. Atchison affairs are no further forward, and 
these bonds also have declined. On the other hand, 
Northern Pacific, Readings, and Union Pacific show a slight 
improvement, compared with the prices of a month ago. 
Although the issue of Government bonds may relieve the 
present tension, there seems little prospect of any movement 
among railway securities until vigorous steps are taken to 
adjust the finances of the bankrupt roads, and in other cases 
until earnings begin to show a greater improvement by 
comparison with the disastrous record of 1894. 


Colonial and Foreign Railways.—It is difficult to sdy 
when Canadian or American railway affairs have reached 
their lowest point, but as regards the former if “ bottom ” has 
not now been touched the future must be gloomy indeed. 
In the early part of the month some comment was caused 
by the persistent selling of Canadian Pacific shares. The 
action 
usual half-yearly dividend for the first time in the history 
of the company. The more sanguine among those interested 
had hoped that a distribution at areduced rate would beforth- 
coming, if not out of revenue, out of the remnant of thereserve 
fand, whichtis still available for the purpose. The directors, 


however, decided in the circumstances to distribute nothing © 


at all. The shares, which stood at 55} at the end of last 
month, had gone down to 50 before the announcement was 
made. Since then a further fall of 6 has taken place, to 44, 


which is a lower price than any previously recorded. ”

A CCC RECO A COE CL ALO 



























































































































Grand Trunk issues have also heavily declined, as the 
ition of the road is so.much worse than the Canadian 
Paci. The fall is very heavy among the bonds of the 
controlled lines since it becomes more and more likely that 
the dreaded question of priority will have to be faced. It is 
tifying to turn to another part of the British dominionsand 
End a condition of flourishing prosperity amongst railways, 
This is the case with the comparatively small group of Indian 
railways, which re ts, however, a very large amount of 
capital. Everyone of these stands at a high premium, ard 
is constantly improving in value. This month there is again 
an ail-round advance of from 1 to 2 points. Among Foreign 
railways, Mexicans show a marked advance, the First 
Preference being most prominent. Central Argentine is 6 
ints up, and so is Cordoba Central debenture stock. 
ther Argentine railways are steady at about last month's 
rices. Brazilians have improved, but Uruguayan stocks 
ave fallen in sympathy with the Government bonds. 
Mining and Miscellaneous.—The “ Kaffir Circus” has sub- 
sided into a state of comparative calm from the feverish 
excitement which formerly reigned there. A good deal of 
business still passes, however, as is to be expected in a 
market representing an industry producing £7,000,000 worth 
of the precious metal per annum, and with “‘ great expecta- 
tions " of the fature. The liquidation of the recent boom is 
searcely completed yet, and a good deal of irregularity 
oceurs from the frequent realisations to secure profits. 
Some of the lower-priced shares have fallen since last 
mouth, but the more prominent issues, such'as City and 
Suburban, Croesus, Jubilee, and Rand Mines are quoted 
substantially higher on comparison. The Diamond shares, 
De Beers, and Jagersfontein have forged ahead, each showing 
a rise of over two points. The West Australian section 
has not hitherto been successful in inaugurating a “boom” 
on itsown account. The shares of many mines, with well- 
known names such as Austin, Bayley’s Reward, and 
Mawson’s Reward are sensibly lower, and it is whispered 
that the new flotations which are being placed on the 
market in rapid succession are not in all cases snapped 
up so eagerly as could be desired by promoters and vendors. 
Land shares, both African and Australian, are fairly well 
maintained in price. In the Miscellaneous market, Bank 
shares have an improving tendency, except in cases where 
specially poor results have been shown by the recent reports. 
Insurance shares of all classes are in d«mand, and show a 
nearly universal improvement. Gas stocks are also in 
favour, those of the companies in the metropolitan area 
showing aspecially strong advance. Water stocks, however, 
have suffered from a quiver of alarm on the part of holders, 
Owing to the efforts of the London County Council to obtain 
control of the undertakings. It seems scarcely logical that 
fas and water stocks should move in such a contrary way, 
since it is natural to suppose that should the Council secure 
the water supply their next step would be to obtain control 
of the gas. Trust stocks have moved irregularly ; Nitrate 
Shares are higher in price; Allsopps have been run up 11 
points in the Ordmary and 8 in the Preference, and some of 
the numerous Brewery debenture stocks have gained a point 
Or two on the month.

are often reduced, and in speculation for the purchase and sale of 
securities during the account one commission is usually charged :—

In reference to the agreement with the South-Eastern C 
the report states that the revision of fares, involv 
where reasonable and necessary, and ‘ levelling down’ in many cases 
where reasonable and possible, has excited some grumbling and

legitimately done in the proper interest of the shareholders in the 
two companies will also prove to be beneficial to the general public, 
with whose interests those of the companies are so inseparably

the past year’s organisation, labour, and expenditure is already 
beginning to make itself felt. 

CITY OF SYDNEY.—The bank transmits by telegraph the following 
results of its half-year’s operations, viz., dividend at the rate of 5 per 
cent. per annum, £10,000; carried forward to next half-year, 
£8,030. 

CLYDESDALE.— Profit and loss shown in our table. The directors 
deeply regret that exceptional losses have been made during last 
year at the Dundee office of the bank amounting to £114,665. The 
directors recommend that this amount should be written off the 
reserve surplus fund which will then stand at £430,335. The directors 
refer to the cancellation of the Baring guarantee, and state that they 
have purchased additional freehold property in London adjoining 
the present offices of the bank.

of the half-yearly meeting of the Commercial Banking Company 
of Sydney (Limited), held in Sydney on the 25th inst. The paid-up 
capital, as increased, amounted to £934,328. Upon this sum a

providing for the interim dividend of £7,500 paid in July last, there 
remains a balance of £13,236, of which £12,500 have been carried to 
the reserve fund,and as the directors do not propose any further 
distribution at present, this will leave £736 to be carried forward, 
The report states that for some time past the bank has bad large 
outstanding advances, principally in South America. The liqui- 
dation of these accounts must necessarily be prolonged. and mean- 
while a large amount of the banks resources is locked up. They 
have, therefore, decided to appropriate their reserves tc these 
accounts. The directors have every reason to anticipate that the 
securities which they now hold against these accounts will before 
long appreciate in value. The directors regret to announce that 
Mr Gwinner, who has been managing director of the bank since its 
foundation, has resigned his office. The business will in future be 
conducted by Mr H. First, the present manager. —

13s per cent. on Post Office Savings’ Bank business, to the injury 
of the trade of general bankers, and presuming to lecture bankers 
on the amount of their reserves, while to cover the whole of the

In reference to the agreement with the South-Eastern Company, 
the report states that the revision of fares, involving ‘ levelling up’ 
where reasonable and necessary, and ‘ levelling down’ in many cases 
where reasonable and possible, has excited some grumbling and 
adverse criticism, but the directors are satisfied that what has been 
legitimately done in the proper interest of the shareholders in the 


two companies will also prove to be beneficial to the general blic, 
with whose interests __ of the com : Se 


s panies are so inseparably 
up. 

MARYPORT AND CARLISLE.—The report for the half-year ended 
December 31 states that the receipts amounted to £50,165, and the 
expenditure, incl rates and taxes, to £26,360. The balance 
of net revenue is £23,804, which, added to £1,690 brought forward, 
enables the directors to recommend a dividend at the rate of 54 per 
cent. per annum, and to carry over a balance of £1,968. The work- 
ing expenses have been 53-62 per cent. of the traffic reveipts ; while

CHEQUE.—Out of an available net profit of £5,323, the annual 
report recommends a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum 
on the ordinary, and of 5 per cent. on the founders’ shares, leaving 
£2,044 to be carried forward. It is added that a steady increase 
has been maintained in every department, and that the result of 
the past year’s organisation, labour, and expenditure is already 
beginning to make itself felt. 

CITY OF SYDNEY.—The bank transmits by telegraph the following 
results of its half-year’s operations, viz., dividend at the rate of 5 per 
pon per annum, £10,000; carried forward to next half-year, 

8,030. 

CLYDESDALE.— Profit and loss shown in our table. The directors 
deeply regret that exceptional losses have been made during last 
year at the Dundee office of the bank amounting to £114,665. The 
directors recommend that this amount should be written off the 
reserve surplus fund which will then stand at £430,335. The directors 
refer to the cancellation of the Baring guarantee, and state that they 
have purchased additional freehold property in London adjoining 
the present offices of the bank. 

COMMERCIAL OF SYDNEY.—Tclegraphic advice has been received 
of the half-yearly meeting of the Commercial Banking Company 
of Sydney (Limited), held in Sydney on the 25th inst. The paid-up 
capital, as increased, amounted to £934,328. Upon this sum a 
dividend for the past hali-year was declared at the rate of 8 per 
cent. per annum, and £14,434 was carried forward. The reserve 
fund remains at £1 ,010,000. 

GERMAN OF LONDON. —The directors have resolved to recommend 
a balance dividend of 5s per share, making with the dividend on 
account of 5s per share, paid in July last, a total of 10s per share, 
equal to 5s for the year 1894, and to add £2,000 to the reserve fund, 
and carry forward £3,341. 

INTERNATIONAL OF LONDON.—The report states that the profits for 
the year 1894, after deduction of expenses, amounted to £19,632, 
making, with £1,1¢4 brought forward, a total of £20,736. After 
providing for the interim dividend of &7,500 paid in July last, there 
remains a balance of £13,236, of which £12,500 have been carried to 
the reserve fund,and as the directors do not propose any further 
distribution at present, this will leave £736 to be carried forward. 
The report states that for some time past the bank has had large 
outstanding advances, principally in South America. The liqui- 
dation of these accounts must necessarily be prolonged, and mean- 
while a large amount of the banks resources is locked up. They 
have, therefore, decided to appropriate their reserves tc these
