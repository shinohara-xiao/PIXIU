THE REDUCTION OF THE BANK RATE. 


Ir was doubtless rather from necessity than choice that 
the Bank directors on Thursday last decided to reduce 
their published rate of discount from 3 to 2} per cent. 


Seeing that there is a foreign demand for gold strong 


enough not only to absork all the market supplies of 
the metal, but also to cause continuous withdrawals from 


the Bank, they must have desired rather that rates 
should advance than that they should fall. There 
was, however, no use in wishing for this unless they 
were prepared to take measures to bring it about ; 
and it was not to be expected that the joint-stock 
banks would rest content with things as they were. 
By maintaining what, in the circumstances, was a ficti- 
tiously high rate, the Bank was causing those institutions 
to lose money. Their rule has been to allow interest on 
deposits at the rate of 14 per cent. under Bank rate, and 
they were consequently paying more for their deposits 
than they could earn upon them. Naturally they were 
not disposed to continue working under such conditions, 
and it is understood that if the Bank directors had not 
reduced the official rate, the banks would have made a new 
departure and fixed their deposit rates independently 
Fortunately such action has not been necessary, because 
it is unsettling for old-established rules of business to be 
departed from. Still the incident is one which the Bank 
directors ought to take serious note of. They must 
remember that heavier responsibilities now rest upon 
In order that they may be enabled to maintain 
an adequate central reserve the joint-stock banks have 
increased their deposits with them by several millions. 
They have the free use of a large portion of that additional 
money, but just because their profit-earning power has 


thus been increased for a certain definite object, they must 
hold themselves bound, if necessary, to incur a greater 
expenditure for the attainment of that object. Conse- 
quently, if through a superabundant supply of money in 
the market rates are being forced down to a lower level 
than they think desirable, ~~ must be readier than 
before to provide the remedy by taking money off the 
market. It will not do for them to sit with their hands 
folded,’ and content themselves with maintaining their 
own rate high above those current outside. That does 
no good, while it is harmfal, by causing those whose 
charges are regulated by the Bank rate to pay more for 
money than it is really worth. It is quite possible that 
the Bank may have to retrace the step it has now taken 
before long, for gold cannot be allowed to slip away as 
it has been doing, and it is not unlikely that the e=lux 
will assume larger dimensions. But however that may 
bé, if the Bank was not prepared to do ere to 
make its 3 per cent. rate more effective, it was bound to 
lower it.

THE RELEASE OF THE DYNAMITERS. 


Tue supporters of the Government are deceived if they 
think that the release of the dynamiters has not produced 
a profound impression upon English public opinion. 
Moderate men of all parties are condemning the action 
taken by Mr Asquith, in agreement with his colleagues, 
and sooner or later the Cabinet will be made to feel the 
ill effects of what they have done. Looked at from no 
point of view can the conduct of the Government be 
justified. In the first place, it is clear that the Ministry 
dp not consider that the men whom they have released 
were unjustly condemned, and innocent of the crimes 
laid to their charge. If they had held such 
an opinion they would have released Egan and 
Callan unconditionally, and would have made every 
amends in their power for the wrongs endured by the 
prisoners. Instead, Mr Asquith released Egan condi- 
tionally and on ticket-of-leave, while Callan was only 
let out of prison on the promise that he would at once go 
to America. This is not the way in which the Home 
Secretary would have treated men whom he believed had 
been enduring the terrible injustice of false imprison- 
ment. The moment it is finally decided that a man was 
wrongly condemned at his trial, his freedom is granted 
to him without treaty or agreement of any sort or kind. 
But, perhaps, it will be said that the Cabinet, though 
it did not believe the prisoners to have been wrongly 
condemned, considered that the crime for which they 
were convicted was not of a sufficiently serious kind 
to justify further detention. Is it possible to hold 
this view when we remember what was always intended, 
and what was sometimes accomplished, by the use of 
dynamite ? An offence more diabolical than a conspiracy 
to explode dynamite in public places, with the deliberate 
intention of injuring as large a number as possible of “ the 
enemies of Ireland,” cannot indeed be conceived. It is 
the purest sophistry to argue that the Irish extremists 
consider themselves at war with England, that the 
dynamite outrages were acts of war, and that therefore 
they ought not to be punished as if they were ordinary 
crimes. The first principle observed in war is the 
principle that always the persons, and as far as possible 
the property, of non-combatants shall be protected 
from injury. The notion of carrying on warlike opera- 
tions by inflicting injary upon women and children, 
old and young, armed and unarmed, indiscriminately, 
is entirely contrary to the conditions under which 
civilised men wage war. Hence to blow up ships, to 
explode dynamite under trains filled with women. and 
children, or to destroy public buildings when they are 
thronged with holiday-makers, cannot under Ssi- 
bility be considered as acts of war. Even gens ae 
the absurd hypothesis that Ireland and England are. at 
war, there is no sort of excuse for the use of dynamite 


Se, 











(January 28, 1893. 


as it was used or intended to be used by the dynamiters. 
We feel that we owe an apology to our readers for having 
dwelt so long upon so ridiculous and sophistical a plea. 
Since, however, it is from time to time put forward as a 
ground for dealing gently with such men as Egan and 
Callan, we have thought it worth while to expose the 
paradoxes and fallacies on which it is based. 

If looked at in regard to the moment chosen for putting 
it into operation, the release of the dynamiters must be 
judged as extraordinarily inopportune. An agitation 
was conducted in Ireland during the summer and autumn 
for the release of the Irish prisoners. At Christmas My 
Morley pardoned the Gweedore convicts, but it was at 
the same time given out that the dynamiters would not 
be released. The release of the men who had been im- 
plicated in the death of Inspector Martin, but not of 
Egan or of any of his fellow prisoners, was immediately 
followed by an explosion at Dublin Castle, by which 
an unfortunate constable was blown to pieces, and 
which but for a series of fortunate accidents might 
have caused a still greater loss of life. That was: 
the answer of the dynamite party to the failure of the 
Home Secretary to act up to their expectations. 
Yet, in spite of this explosion, the Cabinet only allowed a 
month to elapse before they released Egan and Callan. 
Considering the whole circumstances of the case, and 
considering also the temper of the Irish people, could 
anything have been more unwise or more inopportune ? 
The Irish people are unfortunately convinced that nothing 
is ever to be got out of England except by means of inti- 
midation. Prone themselves to be intimidated by violence, 
they believe that Englishmen are equally susceptible to 
moral panic. This view is entertained with special force 
in regard to Mr Gladstone and any Ministry of which he 
is the head. His injudicious and ill-timed remarks 
as to the Clerkenwell explosion, and its effect upon 
public policy, were eagerly caught up by the Irish 
people, and Irish speakers and writers have neve 
ceased to point to his words as indicating that 
nothing is of any avail with England except terror. By 
choosing the moment they did choose for letting out the: 
dynamiters the Government have, then, done a great deal 
to confirm the unfortunate impression which already 
obtains in Ireland as to the best method of enforcing Irish 
demands. We ourselves do not, of course, suppose for a. 
moment that the Government were really intimidated by 
the Dublin explosion. That, however, is not the question. 
They should have considered the probable effect of their 
action in Ireland, and even granted they had determined 
to release the prisoners, they should have chosen a more 
opportune moment than three weeks after a serious 
dynamite outrage. 

We fear, however, that the Government were, as a 
matter of fact, not unaware of the extreme inopportune- 
ness of their action. We regret to be unable to, doubt 
that, as Mr Redmond boasts, the real cause of the release 
of the dynamiters was his threatened amendment to the 
Address—an amendment in favour of which the whole 
Irish party would have been obliged to vote. The 
release of Egan and Callan, therefore, looks as if it were 
partof the purchase-money of the Irishvote, The prerog- 
ative of mercy should be exercised with a solemn and 
judicial sense of responsibility. We fear thaton this occa- 
sion it has been strained to party needs. That in the end 
the Government will profit by these attempts at concilia- 
tion we cannot believe. Already there is far more discon- 
tent in Ireland in regard to the men who are retained in 
prison than gratitude over those who have been released. 
The Government hasin reality gained little or no popularity. 
If it has staved off for a week or two the inevitable breach 
with the Irish extremists, that is the .most favourable 
view that can be taken of the results obtained by a 
grave dereliction of public duty. 














THE. LESSONS OF THE RECENT EGYPTIAN 
INCIDENT. 


Tue recent Egyptian incident is a pleasant one only from 
one point of view. It shows that even under most 


uufe ble circumstances the foreign policy of Great 
Britain will remain continuous. Mr Gladstone is the 





1 St nar on ee en ah lla 








January 28, 1893.] 


head of a party which more or less dislikes the occupa- 
tion of Egypt ; he himself is opposed to its continuance, 
except as a disagreeable necessity, and one of his prin- 
cipal lieutenants has uttered sentences which the whole 
world interpreted into a promise that the country would 
be evacuated as soon as the Liberals regained power. 
Nevertheless, the moment the Khedive attempted to 
force the hand of the British Ministry they offered him 
under diplomatic forms the alternatives of submission or 
dethronement, and the garrison of Egypt, which had 
been reduced to a low point, was suddenly so increased 
that no popular movement was any longer possible. 
That course has received the approval of the whole 
country, and will, we believe, be endorsed when Parlia- 
ment meets by a unanimous vote. Whatever the policy 
of the occupation, it is clearly not to be terminated 
without the consent of Europe, or at the bidding of 
a lad scarcely yet seated on his throne, and neces- 
sarily incompetent to decide on the merits of a great 
policy, or to continue effectively the reforms which have so 
greatly benefited his people. From this point of view the 
affair is satisfactory, because the decision of the Govern- 
ment has unquestionably increased its reputation abroad, 
but it can scarcely be so described from any other. 
It reveals in a very clear light the danger of surprise 
and sudden interruption of the policy of the Empire 
which we incur by continuing the occupation. If cireum- 
stances had been but a little different the caprice of a lad 
of niaeteen might have plunged this country into war, or, 
at ail events, have brought us so near it as to have 
involved what would have been a commercial and 
industrial calamity. That is not a satisfactory position 
to be placed in, more especially as it must be continuous, 
for the Khedive remains on the throne of Egypt, and is 
sure, after his humiliation, to hate the British Govern- 
ment with some malignity. A great deal of authority 
is necessarily in his hands, and more in those of Ministers 
whom he influences. His unfitness for reigning, more- 
ever, tends to lengthen the occupation, it being the 
theory of the European mandate which entrusted 
Egypt to Great Britain that the country should not only 
be reinvigorated, but be placed in the hands of a native 
Government competent to use its restored strength with 
judgment and in accordance with European opinion. 
Finally the brief revolt indicates that the great reforms 
which the agents of this country have effected have not 
conciliated Egyptian feeling to the degree anticipated. 
They may have pleased, as they have certainly benefited, 
the peasantry, but they have not pleased the new 
Sovereign; they have only provoked the ruling classes, 
who profited by the old abuses, and they have attracted 
no favour from the city mobs, who remain, if not exactly 
fanatical, at least decidedly anti-European. All those 
circumstances tend to deepen the impression that the 
occupation, whatever its political wisdom, or even neces- 
sity, involves considerable permanent burdens and dan- 
gers which, in certain quite possible contingencies, might 
prove grave. It is not a new opening for British enter- 
prise only which we acquire in Egypt, but a serious 
responsibility which we have to meet without fully per- 
ceiving how serious it is. 

Perhaps, however, the gravest lesson to be derived 
from the incident is the exceeding difficulty of maintain- 
ing a continuous foreign policy under a system of party 
government which is also democratic. It is nearly 
impossible that a party in opposition should not desire to 
criticise foreign policy, and yet if it does criticise it, it is 
almost certain to do serious mischief. Delicate criticism 
is unintelligible to a popular audience, and strong criticism 
leaves an impression in the first place that the country is 
divided, which of itself weakens the authority of the 
responsible Foreign Minister, by showing how dependent 
his promises or menaces are upon an uncertain popular vote, 
which will probably be given without any reference to that 
policy at all. In the second place, it tends more or less 
to create the division which it seems to announce, be- 
cause the electors, who upon this one subject are self- 
distrustful, naturally take their cue from the language 
of the party leaders, and if inclined to the Opposition 
consider that the Government is leading the country into 
false or even dangeroug positions, And in the third

place, hopes and fears are excited abroad which have the 
most injurious effect, if not upon prestige at least upon 
general confidence that the British Government will be 
steady and persistent. The recent explosion in Egypt 
may have been due to the self-will or ambition of 
the young Khedive, but there can be little doubt 
that he would have displayed neither, had not 
his private advisers, whether French or Turkish, 
deduced from Mr Gladstone’s professed opinions 
and Mr Morley’s most injudicious or even reckless 
utterances a fixed impression that the new party in 
power in London would rather welcome than resent an 
assertion of Egyptian independence. They expected that 
no action would be taken, and that consequently the 
Khedive would be at liberty to appoint or dismiss any 
Ministers he pleased—that is, would be allowed to 
govern Kgypt at his own discretion. Nor if criticisms in 
Opposition were equivalent to statements in office would. 
their impression have been at all unreasonable. Such 
criticisms are not so equivalent, and cannot be from 
want of full knowledge; but the world at large, and 
especially the half-ignorant Oriental world, does not fully 
understand that, and sentences intended only as 
criticisms and for home consumption are taken as if they 
were extracts from State papers announcing final decisions. 
This occurs even with informed persons, as is evident from 
the taunts of the French Press about the tergiversation of 
the Gladstone Ministry, and, of course, with ill-informed 
persons like the leaders of Cairene or Alexandrian mobs, 
it is habitual and inevitable. Their action, again, may 
be as dangerous as that of their rulers, and indeed more 
so, for an excited city mob, if profoundly ignorant, almost 
invariably resorts to personal attacks upon those it 
thinks its enemies, that is often the representatives 
either by position or nationality of the disliked foreign 
Power. The tendency to rash utterances about foreign 
policy will increase as the country becomes more demo- 
cratic, and is so full of risk, if not to the safety of the State, 
at least to the efficacy of its action abroad, that it may 
be questioned whether statesmen should not be bound 
by a rigid etiquette to keep foreign politics out of 
speeches made on the stump, or at least to utter nothing 
on which they have not when in power fully determined 
to act. There must be exceptions to this etiquette in 
emergent cases, or cases suddenly arising; but as a 
general rule of conduct it is, we are convinced, 
wise, and that not only for the reasons stated, 
but for another to which we have not yet alluded. 
Owing to the habitual moderation of English states- 
men when discussing foreign politics, as contrasted 
with the decision with which the country acts 
when its mind is made up, the Continent is always 
tempted to accuse the British Government of untruthful- 
ness, if not of positive treachery,and to declare that 
while always suave in words it is always seeking its own 
advantage by some violent course. Indiscreet criticisms 
in Opposition greatly increase this temptation, for the 
critic is expected when he assumes power to act up to the 
policy suggested by his criticism, and, as he ean rarely 
do this, he is accused of falseness. His policy in action 
creates intense disappointment, as well as irritation, and 
he himself is thenceforward distrusted, even when he is 
giving official assurances. These risks, which are serious, 
as is evident from this Egyptian affair, should be avoided, 
and the only way to avoid them is to avoid, so far as 
possible, extra Parliamentary criticism upon the foreign 
policy of the country, or, at least, to speak with a full 
and permanent consciousness that words are on such a 
subject constantly liableto be considered abroad as equiva- 
lent to pledges which a Ministry is bound in honour to 
redeem. 








LABOUR STATISTICS. 


THERE is one thing that Mr Giffen demonstrated very 
clearly in, his evidence before the Labour Commission, 
and thet ts the extreme meagreness of the i prong 
which the Board of Trade have collected. Mr Giffen did, 
indeed, claim that practically a census of wages has bee: 

taken, and proce to submit.to the Commission an 
elaborate estimate of the aggregate income of our working

sr cecal inte att. 








population, based upon the information that had been 
obtained. That information, however, is of the most 
fragmentary kind. ‘To begin with, it refers to only thirty- 
eight out of the multitudinous industries in which our 
people find employment, and even this small number 
of occupations has been only very partially dealt 
with. Thus, for instance, the returns relating to 
our mining industries embrace only 16 per cent. of 
the total number of persons employed, and although in 
other industries the proportion of workers accounted for 
is somewhat larger, yet in all it is relatively small. 
Besides—and this is even more important—the wages 
dealt with are not recent wages. They are the wages 
current in a certain selected week in October, 1886; 
whilst the estimate of the number of persons in receipt 
of wages is based upon the census of 1881. Even, there- 
fore, if Mr Giffen’s estimate of the annual income of the 
working classes were as trustworthy as it appears to us to 
be unreliable, its present utility would be of the smallest. 
For the present income must of necessity be very 
different from the income of 1886. True, Mr Giffen 
asserts that ‘the variation in average money earnings 
from year to year in the whole bulk of employments has 
beenvery small.’’ But, then, he confessedly speaks without 
knowledge, for norecord of the movement in wages has been 
obtained by the Board of Trade, and his statement is con- 
trary to all recorded experience. It is,indeed, beyond ques- 
tion that wages rose very considerably between 1886 and 
1891, and of the rise then secured a good deal has since 
been maintained. And, apart from the rate of wages, the 
income of the working classes is greatly affected from 
year to year by the quantity of employment obtained. If 
Mr Giffen will turn to the reports of Mr Burnett, the 
Labour Correspondent of the }Board, he will see that, 
whereas at the close of 1886 no less than 10 per cent. 
of the members of the trade unions who render monthly 
returns to the Board were out of employment, at the close 
of 1889 the proportion of unemployed was only 1-5 per 
cent. And if we are to accept the condition of these trades 
as typical of the general condition of trade—which Mr 
Burnett thinks we may—then,’on Mr Giffen’s calculation 
that there is a working population (including men, women, 
and children) of 13,277,000, earning on an average £48 
per head per annum, this difference of 8°5 per cent. in the 
numbers employed in 1886 and 1889 respectively repre- 
sents a difference in aggregate earnings of over £50,000,000. 
Add to that even a 5 per cent. variation in the rate of 
wages, and we have a difference in the aggregate earn- 
ings of the two years of more than £80,000,000. Mr 
Giffen may think that a ‘‘ very small” variation, but he 
will, it seems to us, find few to agree with him. As to 
the details of Mr Giffen’s estimates, however, we shall 
have more to say on a future occasion. What we wish 
to emphasise at present is, that all such estimates are of 
little practical worth. They furnish scope for imaginative 
calculations, but these are not what we want from the 
Board of Trade. The two things which Mr Giffen can 
tell us nothing about—that is, the current rates of wages 
and the lack or abundance of employment—are precisely 
the things which are of immediate practical importance. 
And now that a new Labour Department is being 
organised, what we would press upon the Government is, 
that it is to the collection and publication of information 
as to the current fluctuations in the employment and 
remuneration of labour that their attention should be 
directed. What working-man is a penny the better for 
such a calculation as that which Mr Giffen makes; and if 
it is not to be for the benefit of the working population, 
what is to be the real utility of the new Department ? 
We have said that we regard Mr Giffen’s estimate of 
the aggregate income of the working classes as unreliable, 
and that we purpose on another occasion giving the 
reasons for cur opinion. It may be well, however, to 
show from one example how fallacious all calculations of 
the kind are apt to be. In the coutse of his evidence, Mr 
Giffen made an estimate of the savings, as well as the 
earnings of the working-classes, and, after pointing out that 
the annual income of trade unions was nearly £1,200,000 
. , , , 
or 27s 6d per head, he is reported by the Times to have 
added: ‘The income of the union members who 
‘belonged mostly to the higher grades would probably

‘« difference in the condition of the working classes.” 
What Mr Giffen could have been thinking of when he 
made this statement we cannot imagine. If he had simply 
referred to the Annual Statistical Abstract, compiled 
under his direction, he would have seen that in addition 
to the £6,200,000 at which he estimates the money savings 
of the working classes, exclusive of the amount placed in 
friendly societies and building societies, there are no less 
than about £5,000,000 paid by them annually in the shape 
of premiums to industrial insurance companies. To these 
£5,000,000 have to be added the amounts witich the 
workmen contribute to the mutual insurance funds by 
which they, in conjunction with their employers, seek to 
make provision against accident, and the very consider- 
able sums which—in Scotland, at all events—they deposit

One other point in Mr Giffen’s evidence may be briefly 
Asked’ how the 


‘not sufficiently full statistics of the: wages and' earnings 
‘“‘of the peasant proprietors in the United States, of 
‘“‘ whom there were betweerm 10,000,000 and 41,000,000, 
‘to enable him to make an exact comparison; but he had 
“ arrived at the conclusion that the average earnings, man 
‘for man, of the working classes in the United Kingdom 
‘‘were not much lower than the: earnings of similar 
“classes in the United States.’” Now, primd facie, 
this is a statement which it would be impossible to 
accept without very clear proof. It is notorious that 
the cost of living in the Wnited' States is very con- 
siderably higher than it is Were, and if the money wages 
are not higher, then it follows that the working classes 
in the States cannot be at all so well off as are our own. 
That, however, is not in accordanee with the general 
belief, and it would be well if Mr Giffen could substan-. 
tiate his statement, especially as we have just received’ 
the report for 1891 of the Massachusetts Labour 
Bureau, from which it appears that the average earnings 
in that year of all the employés in 75 enumerated 
branches of trade amounted to £88 per head. Mr Giffen 
may possibly have better information as to the rate of 
wages in the States than the Massachusetts officials. If 
so, it would be interesting to have it produced. 





THE SITUATION IN ARGENTINA. 
(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) 
Bvenos Ayres, December 27. 


As the year draws to a close the difficulties and 
dangers of all kinds which the new Argentine Adminis- 
tration has to face appear to thicken round it, and are 
being dealt with in a feeble kind of way, which impresses 
the public with the conviction that President Peiia’s 
Government will never be able to restore the republic’s 
internal peace and external credit, It is now looking 
on with folded arms, while a revolution is raging 
in the important proyince of Corrientes, in which

THE ECONOMIST. 97

much blood has already been shed. The first revolution 
under General Roca’s administration was in the same 
province of Corrientes; but he went in person with a 
few thousand men and stamped it out in a week. 

Then the feeble and unpopular Government has also on 
hand a question with Chili which sprung up within the 
last week with even greater suddenness than the Corrientes 
revolution. It is not a very serious question, but it must 
be taken as evidence that a serious one may arise when 
least expected. In the beginning of last week some 
sensational news as to a large purchase of Manser rifles 
by the Paraguayan Government, to be paid for by Chili, 
and an alliance between these countries, was published, 
and the result was a summons from President Pejia to the 
leading men of all parties to give him the benefit of their 
advice at a solemn Council, which lasted several hours. 
Generals Roca and Mitre, ex-President Pellegrini, Dr 
Zebullos, ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr Quirno 
Costa, the new Minister to Chili, and other notables 
were present. The Bolsa and the public at once 
divined, on seeing General Roca amongst the President’s 
councillors, that there was something wrong, and the gold 
premium began to rise. The Nacion, General Mitre’s 
paper and private property, then published an article 
evidently meant to allay the anxiety of the public, which 
stated that the Council had solely under consideration 
the final orders to be given to the Commissioners for 
arranging the houndary line with Chili, and who are to 
leave for that country next week. Nevertheless, the 
same influential organ published the following morning, 
with some very severe comments, extracts from a pam- 
phlet implicating the Chilian Minister here, who was agent 
in this country for the revolutionists during the war 
against Balmaceda, showing how he had organised help 
for the rebels here, how he had bribed the Argentine 
telegraph clerks and intercepted despatches, and done 
other things which revolutionary agents all over the world 
do, but take care to keep to themselves, especially when 
their side wins and they are transformed from revolu- 
tionary agents into Ministers Plenipotentiary. Although 
somewhat alarming telegrams have been sent abroad in 
reference to this affair, the public attach no importance 
to it, and the so-called street demonstration against the 
Transandine republic was confined to a few hundred boys, 
easily dealt with by the police. The significance of the 
affair lies in the strong probability that the pamphlet, 
of which a Chilian named Tupper is the nominal author, 
was not published without the knowledge and consent of 
the Chilian Government and its Minister here, Senor 
Guerrero. The purpose is not so evident. Perhapsit is 
to see how much provocation the Argentines will require 
when the time comes for the struggle between the two 
countries, which every man in both considers to be in- 
evitable. 

Apart from these foreign and internal complications 
President Pefa’s hold on public opinion—never very 
strong, and chiefly based on the wish for improved 
administration being father to the thought in the minds 
of the plundered people—is waning every day. He has 
been in office only two months and some days, and the 
political confusion here and in the provinces is worse 
than ever. The Federal Government, instead of being 
at least a regulating force for its provincial satellites, is 
manifestly merely a shuttlecock for the battledores of all 
the political intriguers in the country, and has no weight 
whatever with any party, while having none of its own. 
The well-meaning President’s attempt to govern without 
party was from the first destined to fail, and the failure 
is becoming apparent much sooner than expected. Some 
short-sighted people appear to think that, when Congress 
goes into recess until May next, the National Adminis- 
tration will get on more smoothly, and be able to sow 
the seeds of reform in many directions. I fear these 
optimists are destined to disappointment, and that a 
break down of the Government is much more probable, 
unless Dr Pejia has the good sense to abandon his 
Utopian idea of governing without party, and sum- 
mon permanently to his aid the parties that raised 
him to power, just as he has done in asking 
the leaders of the said parties for counsel in the Chilian 
affair. I am in @ position to state positively that the 





President has of late made several efforts for a ‘ rap- 
prochement”” to Dr Bernardo Irigoyen, the Radical 
candidate for Presidential honours, but they have all 
been firmly and consistently rejected. The Radicals are 
the only consistent political party in the country at 
present. The failure of the President’s son, Dr Roque 
Saenz Peiia, as a leader of the embryonic ‘‘ Modern” 
party, and his resignation of his seat in the National 
Senate is in a way a favourable sign, but Dr Pizarro, 
Governor of Cordoba, another Modern, who adopted 


resignation of that post ten days ago as a ruse to get rid. 


of one of his Ministers, has withdrawn his resignation ati 
the urgent request of President Pena, and is again in 
power. 

That nothing whatever has been changed in our system 
of government, except the members of the Executive, 
is proved by the way in which Congress is dealing with 
the Budget for next year, the broad figures of which I 
referred to in my last communication. The deficit of 14 
millions of gold dollars is likely to be considerably aug- 
mented by the increased expenditure that is being 
sanctioned at every successive sitting of both Houses of 
the Legislature. It is well to bear in mind that the retrench- 
ment promised by President Peiia in the way of reducing 
employés and their salaries, and cutting short the reckless 
waste of public money in a thousand ways, which has 
become a chronic abuse, has not even been attempted ; 
and that Congress has not only done nothing towards the 
retrenchment and reform that are essential if the c ountry 
is to be saved from repudiation, but has absolutely shown 


itself adverse to both by sanctioning a Budget with a: 
large deficit, voting large subsidies to foster the fatal. 


system of Protection (of which the new Finance Minister 


has just publicly professed himself a warm supporter), 
salaries to the amount of two 


voting increased 
millions, instead of cutting them down, and acting 
in every way as if madness had seized the Legis- 
lators, and the ruin, not the salvation, of their: 
country were the object they had in view. The Finance 
Minister, in place of protesting against all this, or throw- 
ing up his post, has tacitly consented to it and favoured. 
it by his public profession of Protectionism. He has 
gone further and has concluded, or all but concluded. an: 
agreement with the German bankers who hold the famous 
$11,000,000 Bond of the National Bank in liquidation to 
pay them £150,000 cash, and £25,000 monthly till the whole 
amount is paid. This is a gross transaction, and illegal ; 
there is no provision made for it in the Budget, and Peter 
must be robbed to pay Paul; it is grossly unfair, not to 
say dishonest, towards the other creditors of the nation, 
who are about to be asked to forego much more, I fear, 
than half of their just claims. 

Conferences are still going on between the Finance 
Minister of Buenos Ayres Province and Mr Essex Rende 
representing Baring Bros., Messrs O. Bemberg and Co. 
representing Morton, Rose, and Co., and Mr Muilmann 
agent for the other bankers interested in the foreign debt 
of the province. There is some hitch, as Morton, Rose, 
and Co. have only been given a week to settle it, whereas 
they asked for six weeks. Iam unable to give you any 
particulars, but have some reason to think that lease of 
the La Plata port on onerous terms that will vir- 
tually amount to a sale, is not unlikely to form part 
of the bargain. It may be doubted whether the 
National Congress will sanction the bargain as to the 

rt. 

The gold premium rose sharply to-day, and then 
relapsed a little. The bloody civil strife in Corrientes is 
partly the cause of the rise, as it is feared that other 
provinces (amongst them Buenos Ayres) will soon be in 
a blaze. It was also rumoured this afternoon that there 


is another split in the Cabinet, with a strong probability , 


that ex-President Pellegrini will be asked to take a port- 
folio, and Dr Quintana, who resigned not a month ago; 
to return to the post of Minister of the Interior. This 
would mean a clearance of all the present Cabinet, and 
a new Finance Minister less opposed to inconvertible 
note issues than Dr Romero. There is, apparently, 
some radical Cabinet change at hand, and it is seater, 
as all faith in the present Ministers has vanished. It 
will, however, be a very serious thing indeed if a Finance

OUR FOREIGN AND COLONIAL TRADE OF LAST 
| ‘YBAR COMPARED IN QUANTITY AND VALUE 
| WITH THAT OF 1891. 


II.—EXPORTS. 
— the same analysis as was done last week for 
the imports, a similar view is here presented of the export 
trade of last year as regards the proportionate share 
which increase or decrease of quantities and prices had in 
forming the total variation in the values presented in the 
monthly abstract for December, 1892. 

The figures then dealt with for the imports were those 
of the whole arrivals of foreign and colonial goods. In 
the second of the following tables those again sent out of 
the country are to be found, and these should be deducted 
from the gross imports to arrive at the correct amount 
of those remaining as available for home consumption. 
Making this alteration, the totals given last week must 
be reduced, and the comparison with 1891 stands thus :—

The chief points of interest growing out of these calcula- 
tions may be thus summarised :— 

1. The total value of the trade of 1892 is £29,370,200 
below that of 1891, of which £11,799,101 is due to dimi- 
nution in the value of the imports and £20,174,926 to 
the lessened value of British exports ; these diminutions, 
however, being partially offset by an increase of 
£2,603,827 in the re-exports of foreign goods. 

2. In truth, however, there has been a slight increase 
in the volume of trading operations in the interchange of 
goods, which represented in money terms amounts to 
£4,124,000, being the difference between £6,904,000, an 
increase in the direct imports, and £5,664,000 in the re- 
exports, and a decrease of £8,444,000 in the British 
There has thus been a slightly larger supply 
of imports retained, to the extent of £1,240,000 in 
quantity, accompanied by a saving in cost of no less 
than £15,643,000. But in the exports, the tale told is 
different, for we have sold £8,444,000 less in bulk, and 
lost £11,731,000 in the prices obtained on the lesser 
quantity. 

4. In the import quantities, food represents more 
by £9,000,000, and the materials for manufacture are less 
by £2,000,000; but on these raw materials there has 
been a saving of £10,000,000 in price, which goes far to 
neutralise the loss upon the exports.

AUSTRALIAN AFFAIRS. 

MELBOURNE, Dee. 22, 1892. 
RATHER more than a year has now elapsed since the 
acute stage of the Australian crisis was entered upon. 
This crisis has affected Victoria, New South 
Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania in varying degrees. 
It left South Australia untouched, because that colony 
has never recovered elasticity since the severe depression 
through which it passed from 1883 to 1887. Western 
Australia was also outside the sphere of its influence, 
being encouraged by the gift of constitutional Govern- 
ment to plunge into ill-considered experiments in borrow- 
ing and lavish expenditure on its own account. With 
the Australian continent, New Zealand has now little in 
common, and resting upon its own resources, this 
colony has been industrially progressive for some years. 
past. The nature and characteristics of the Australian 
crisis deserve the closest examination at the hands of 
political economists, because, while the causes of the 
crisis have been largely out of the common, the field upon 
which they have operated has been well defined, and 
isolated in a rare degree. The crisis has been at once 
financial, commercial, and industrial. Evidences abound 
that the last seven years have formed the sturm wnd 
drang period of Australia’s material interests. The 
partial breakdown of financial institutions, the consequent 
depression of trade, the disorganisation of industrial en- 
terprise, the accumulating pile of indebtedness, extrava- 
gant expenditure, and burdensome taxation, are com- 
mencing to remodel the views of the people, and to bring 
home to them that they cannot expect to have the sound 
principles of economic science overturned for their benefit. 
The possible serious difficulties of public finance in more 
than one colony would complete for the present the 
trials of Australia, and finaily prepare the way for recon- 
struction. 

The growing disorganisation of Australian public finances 
is the result principally of the difficulty experienced in 
obtaining funds to keep loan expenditure going. This 
expenditure has increased at even a faster rate than the 
borrowing, and notwithstanding that the colonies bor- 
rowed £37,000,000 in the four years ended Dec. 31st last,

OUR FOREIGN AND COLONIAL TRADE OF LAST 
YEAR COMPARED IN QUANTITY AND VALUE 
WITH THAT OF 1891. 


II1.—EXPORTS. 
Punsurxe the same analysis as was done last week for 
the imports, a similar view is here presented of the export 
trade of last year as regards the proportionate share 
which increase or decrease of quantities and prices had in 
forming the total variation in the values presented in the 
monthly abstract for December, 1892. 

The figures then dealt with for the imports were those 
of the whole arrivals of foreign and colonial goods. In 
the second of the following tables those again sent out of 
the country are to be found, and these should be deducted 
from the gross imports to arrive at the correct amount 
of those remaining as available for home consumption. 
Making this alteration, the totals given last week must 
be reduced, and the comparison with 1891 stands thus :-—

The chief points of interest growing out of these calcula- 
tions may be thus summarised :— 

1. The total value of the trade of 1892 is £29,370,200 
below that of 1891, of which £11,799,101 is due to dimi- 
nution in the value of the imports and £20,174,926 to 
the lessened value of British exports; these diminutions, 
however, being partially offset by an increase of 
£2,603,827 in the re-exports of foreign goods. 

2. In truth, however, there has been a slight increase 
in the volume of trading operations in the interchange of 
goods, which represented in money terms amounts to 
£4,124,000, being the difference between £6,904,000, an 
increase in the direct imports, and £5,664,000 in the re- 
exports, and a decrease of £8,444,000 in the British 
exports. There has thus been a slightly larger supply 
of imports retained, to the extent of £1,240,000 in 
quantity, accompanied by a saving in cost of no less 
than £15,643,000. But in the exports, the tale told is 
different, for we have sold £8,444,000 less in bulk, and 
lost £11,731,000 in the prices obtained on the lesser 
quantity. 

4. In the import quantities, food represents more 
by £9,000,000, and the materials for manufacture are less 
by £2,000,000; but on these raw materials there has 
been a saving of £10,000,000 in price, which goes far to 
neutralise the loss upon the exports. 



















































AUSTRALIAN AFFAIRS. 
MeELBoukNE, Dec. 22, 1892. 


RatHER more than a year has now elapsed since the 
acute stage of the Australian crisis was entered upon. 
This crisis has affected Victoria, New South 
Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania in varying degrees. 
It left South Australia untouched, because that colony 
has never recovered elasticity since the severe depression 
through which it passed from 1883 to 1887. Western 
Australia was also outside the sphere of its influence, 
being encouraged by the gift of constitutional Govern- 
ment to plunge into ill-considered experiments in borrow- 
ing and lavish expenditure on its own account. With 
the Australian continent, New Zealand has now little in 
common, and resting upon its own resources, this 
colony has been industrially progressive for some years 
past. The nature and characteristics of the Australian 
crisis deserye the closest examination at the hands of 
political economists, because, while the causes of the 
crisis have been largely out of the common, the field upon 
which they have operated has been well defined, and 
isolated in a rare degree. The crisis has been at once 
financial, commercial, and industrial. Evidences abound 
that the last seven years have formed the sturm und 
drang period of Australia’s material interests. The 
partial breakdown of financial institutions, the consequent 
depression of trade, the disorganisation of industrial en- 
terprise, the accumulating pile of indebtedness, extrava- 
gant expenditure, and burdensome taxation, are com- 
mencing to remodel the views of the people, and to bring 
home to them that they cannot expect to have the sound 
principles of economic science overturned for their benefit. 
The possible serious difficulties of public finance in more 
than one colony would complete for the present the 
trials of Australia, and finaily prepare the way for recon- 
struction. 

The growing disorganisation of Australian public finances 
is the result principally of the difficulty experienced in 
obtaining funds to keep loan expenditure going. This 
expenditure has increased at even a faster rate than the 
borrowing, and notwithstanding that the colonies bor- 
' rowed £37,000,000 in the four years ended Dec. 31st-last,

most of them at that date had considerable liabilities to 
meet which were unprovided for. Although by hook or 
by crook they have managed to obtain about £6,500,000 
more this year, nearly the whole of this sum has gone to 
liquidate obligations already incurred, and further expen- 
diture is mostly entered upon in anticipation of further 
borrowing. Several of the Governments have large deficits 
yet to meet. The New South Wales Government had 
used up all available resources, trust funds, savings bank 
funds, &c., at the time it resolved to try a local loan, and 
had close upon £3,000,000 to find. The Victorian 
Government, while showing by bookkeeping entries that 
it still has a balance available for fresh public works, is 
steadily exhausting its cash resources, and must, by June 
next, be at the point of begging the bauks for temporary 
assistance, unless it can float new loans. The proceeds 
of its last loan have to some extent practically gone to 
cover the growing revenue deficit. For the first five 
months of the present fiscal year (which commenced 
on July 1st) Customs show a decrease of £130,500, as 
compared with the corresponding period last year, the 
territorial revenue has fallen off, and for the first 24 


Parliament, is working badly for the revenue. The 
Ministry has not been sufficiently awake to see that 
where the stamp duties of a group of adjacent colonies 
differ materially, business will be driven from the place 
where the duties are high to that where they are low. 
The stamp duties affecting bankers are lower in Adelaide 
than in Melbourne, and the consequence is that a great 
deal of financial business has been driven to the former 
place. The clause affecting marine insurance business 
arranged with companies having their head offices out- 
side Victoria is most tyrannical. In order to reach some 
half-dozen large houses who declare under open policies, 
it has been enacted that everybody declaring under such 
policies for customers—a gratuitous piece of service 
commonly rendered by merchants throughout the colonies || 
—must take out a licence at a heavy cost. The large 
concerns aimed at have greatly altered their method of 
declaring, so that the Victorian Government cannot 
reach them; but the trading houses in Melbourne are 
feeling the inconvenience of the clause. 

According to the provisions of the Absentee Income 
Tax Bill, now before the Parliament of Victoria, money 
lent on mortgage in the colony from abroad is not to be 
affected. But owing to the intensity of the financial 
crisis, a great deal of property has come into the hands of 
British lenders, who, having preferred to get the titles 
transferred to themselves, are no longer mortgagees in 
possession. They will, therefore, have to pay the Absentee 
Income Tax ifthe Bill passes in its present form. 

As month follows month the depression in Melbourne 
continues to deepen, although without much incident. 
Thrown back upon their own resources, the people of the 
colony are finding it difficult to make rapid progress. 
Numerous arrangements with creditors are again pending. 
The result of the long series of failures »f companies and 
individuals is that a large proportion of the real property 
of Melbourne has fallen into the hands of creditors, while 
rents have fallen so low as to almost destroy the old 
criteria of values. 

Another consequence of the depression is that the 
finances of most of the municipalities surrounding the 
City of Melbourne are falling into a state of dilapidation, 
and difficulty is being experienced in raising money to 
pay the current interest on debenture loans. A great 
deal of the money which has been borrowed has gone into 
works of little general utility, often for the benefit of in- 
dividuals, while the cost of most of the useful works 
should have come out of the ordinary revenue. The con- 
dition of these municipalities needs watching. As regards 
the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, 
portion of its borrowings will be duly annexed by Govern- 
ment through “ protective’’ duties. A large quantity of 
cement is being used by the Board, and if they should 
require say 1,000,000 barrels from first to last, the new 
duty will bring about £175,000 into the Custom House. 
This shows how borrowing from abroad can be made to 
swell the public revenue. The practice of clipping the 
borrowed millions by the action of protective duties has 
seriously enhanced the public burden, and is an element 
in the depreciation of colonial credit. 

The wool season is approaching its close. One result 
of the American Presidential election has been to keep 
American buyers—who have hitherto taken fine wool at 
prices 1d and 2d per lb over their intrinsic value—off the 
market, until it can be seen whether Congress is 
going to do anything about the duties on wool. The 
sales have in consequence suffered somewhat. The 
wheat crops in New South Wales, South Australia, 
and Victoria are reported upon favourably, and the 
exportable surplus will be larger than that of last 
year. The gold mining industry is steady. Silver mining 
has to be regarded with caution, the local influences which 
come into play from time to time not always being 
healthy. There is a great deal of discussion carried on | 
respecting the quantity of easily-worked ores still to be | 
obtained from the Broken Hill mines. There is an 
enormous quantity of sulphide ore, but no process has | 
Scmeeialiht alii cemaiaiae oe ' yet been introduced for treating it profitably. The market

The outlook is a serious revenue deficit. Under these cir- 
cumstances, the Treasurer is proposing to issue a local 
loan, but the proposal is very unpalatable to most of the 
banks. It is feared also that he will propose that the 
Government shall take over the ‘‘ Commissioners’ 
Savings Bank ”’ of the colony, which holds £1,126,000 on 
fixed deposit with the banks, a sum sufficient to consti- 


colony as dark as possible. Even the full report of the 
Audit Commissioners which invariably discloses important 
details, has not yet been published, although overdue. 

As to the conduct of New South Wales finance, the 
following extract from the yearly financial address of the 
Treasurer, delivered on 14th inst., is almost sufficient 
description :—‘* The Treasurer is practically powerless to 
control the finances. He is liable at any moment to have 
a number of accounts to meet, of the existence of which 
he was unaware until they were presented. The charging 
of our expenditure during the year for the year will not 
meet the case; it can only be remedied by the various 
Ministers abstaining from entering into contracts for 
which no funds are available, or votes are insufficient.”’ 
It is not merely the Treasurer who exercises next to no 
practical control. It is the same with Parliament. 

One effect of the events of the last seven years is seen 
in the serious losses made in banking. Six Australasian 
banks in all have gone out of existence, and including 
writings-down by other institutions, the total amount of 
banking capital which has disappeared exceeds five 
millions, as follows :—Paid-up capital, £3,278,800, and 





Australasian banking will be conducted on exceedingly 
cautious lines for the future. 

The Victorian Government continues to show a marked 
reluctance to sanction prosecutions in connection with 
any of the recent failures. The counsel employed in 
behalf of the English liquidator of the Mercantile Bank 
of Australia have, after a thorough investigation, recom- 
mended the prosecution of the directors, the manager, 
and the auditors on a charge of issuing a falss balance- 
sheet. But the Ministry seem determined to burke 
inquiry, if they can do so without jeopardising their own 
existence. In this they are quietly supported by a con- 
siderable portion of Parliament, including prominent 
members of the Opposition, the singular contention being 
raised, that, inasmuch as some of the persons implicated 
held high office in the State, to prosecute them would be 
to show disregard for the position of the State in the 
eyes of the world. The identity of the alleged offenders 
with the State is upheld, and, therefore, they should not 
be placed upon their trial. Public opinion may force the 
Government to take action, but the susceptibility to 
occult influences, the disregard of the claims of public 
morality which have been manifested, cannot impress one

and as the buying has been cautious, the recovery, so far | establishment andthe extension of the business, and which

BUSINESS NOTES. 


The Rig on the Scotch Pig-Iron Warrant Market.—The 
Pig-Iron Warrant Market at Glasgow is once again in a 
ferment. Not for very many months has there been so 
much heated excitement as has been witnessed in the 
past ten days, during which time the “bears” of the 
market have dropped more money than they made in the 
course of the last twelve months. Throughout the autumn 
and the early part of the winter business was so bad in the 
at-one-time famous ring that many members withdrew to 
other walks, and those who remained admittedly did not 
cover office expenses. The public kept wholly aloof, and the 
inside dealing was of no apparent account. But there 
are anumber of bold speculators in the companionship, 
and believing that the idleness could only issue in gradu- 
ally declining prices, they pursued a selling policy on all 
occasions. The lots dealt in were moderate individually, and 
they were generally placed well forward for delivery ; in the 
aggregate they assumed large proportions, which, however, 
created no concern, as the legitimate position was bad, and 
quotations followed the downward course that had been 
reckoned on. As it now transpires, there was all through 
another anda strong party to the operation, who were 
quietly yet steadily picking up all the lots offered, a!low- 
ing them at the same time to lie on the market, which 
thus acquired a “bullish” rather than a“ bearish” 
appearance. These tactics were followed until the 
opportune period fell due—until nearly all the leaders in 
the market had soundly committed themselves to the fall 
—and then, all available warrants having been safely 
secured, delivery against open sales was requested. The 
pressure was first applied on the opening of the market 
after the New Year holidays, when Scotch cash iron 
was quoted 41s9d. With a few trifling fluctuations, the 
figure has gradually been raised since then, until on 
Thursday 44s 11}d was reached, and where it may go to 
no one knows. The “ shorts” are completely in the power 
of the“ longs,” who are doling out relief in very small lines. 
It is very satisfactory that the public are not to any ex- 
tent involved in this gamble, for it is neither more nor 
less than such. And this is the depth to which the pig- 
iron market has been wholly reduced. Legitimate in- 
fluences have not weighed one iota in the balance, as is 
shown even now in the fact that while cash iron is selling 
at 45s, three months forward can be had from the syndi- 
cate, who are cornering, at 42s. The effect, as in all past 
operations of the same kind, has been to demoralise the 
legitimate trade position. It is bad enough, in all con- 
science, and can ill bear the disorganising influence 
of such speculation as has been described. Of 
the hundreds of thousands of tons which have changed 
hands of late, probably not a single ton had the 
most remote connection with business proper. 


Parliament and the London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow 
Assurance Company. — Two or three weeks ago we 
referred to the affairs of the London, Edinburgh, and 
Glasgow Assurance Company, which finds itself in such 
straits that very radical measures have had to be proposed 
for its resuscitation. It will be remembered that the 
company was one of those in which Mr Jabez Spencer 
Balfour—of whose dealings with the savings of the 
poorer classes we have recently had sad experience—took 
a share in the management. We pointed out that the 
Board of Trade had year after year been compelled to 
direct attention to the company’s method of rendering 
their accounts. In their latest return, in order to 
balance their accounts they had to include as an 
asset a sum of £305,700 which had been spent on the 


had nothing to represent it except the existing business. 
The Board of Trade naturally objected, and the objec- 
tion like similar objections in previous years, was 
submitted to Parliament. The only reply which the 
company vouchsafed was that the course followed 
was a right and proper one, and, moreover, that what- 
ever difference of opinion there existed as to this large 
item, the security of the policy-holders was guaranteed 
by the fact that in addition to the investments specially 
secured to policy-holders, the company possessed a 
large subscribed capital uncalled. It has since been 
admitted, however, that the policy-holders possessed 
no such security, for in spite of their statement, 
the directors had pledged the uncalled capital for 
loans with which to carry on the business. There 
was thus a distinct misrepresentation made by the 
company to Parliament through the Board of Trade, 
and if the presentation of these reports to Parliament is 
not to be considered a mere farce, Parliament must 
certainly take cognizance of the fact, and inquire into it. 
There is a great deal being said at the present time as 
to the interests of the working classes, and we trust 
that when the House meets one or other of those 
mnembers who are desirous of looking after those interests 
will call attention to this matter, not only in crJer that 
the safety of a further mass of the savings of pocr people 
may not be left in doubt, but also that it may be shown 
that Parliament may not be misled with impunity. 


ee —s 


Writing Down Bank Properties.—At the meeting on 
Wednesday, of the English, Scottish, and Australian 
Chartered Bank, the chairman explained that the bank’s 
properties which had been written down to a low rate, 
had been written up again, in order to make good a loss 
of £200,000 that had occurred. It is, of course, a com- 
mon practice of the banks to hold what may be termed 
undisclosed reserves by writing down certain of their 
assets to a figure below their real value. Thus, we fre- 
quently find the Consols held by a bank written down to 
90, and the premises—as in the case of Parr’s Banking 
Corporation, according to the statement of the chairman 
atthe meeting on Thursday—written down to their brick 
and mortar value. In these cases the banks, of course, 
possess undisclosed reserves to the amount of the dif- 
ference between the real value of the assets and 
the figure to which they are written down. It 
might be said that, in one way, it is not really material 
whether a bank which finds it a necessity to draw upon 
its resources chooses to diminish its ordinary reserve 
fund or to treat its undisclosed reserve as an available 
security. But to us this method adopted by the English, 
Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank, of writing up 
again the value of its property, seems perhaps the 
least judicious that could have been adopted. It 
is apt to give the impression that the values are being 
strained so as to give a good appearance to the balance- 
sheet, and of all things that is, perhaps, one of the worst 
that a bank can do. It would therefore, we think, have 
been even preferable for the English, Scottish and 
Australian Chartered Bank to have written the whole 
amount of the loss off its available funds, for then people 
would have believed that they knew the worst, and would 
have regained confidence. We are not saying that the 
bank’s valuation of the property it has written up is really 
wrong. Far from it. All that we are pointing out is 
that the proceeding may be taken, quite erroneously, as 
a kind of juggle of accounts. The truth, indeed, is that 
the undisclosed reserve can hardly ever be resorted to by 
a bank when it is a going concern, without producing 
a very bad impression, however valuable such a reserve 
may prove in such an event as the winding up of the 
business. 





American Railway Earnings in 1892.—So far as gross 
earnings go the American railways fared well in 1892.

Chronicle, are as follows :—

The mileage operated in 1892, of course, exceeded that 
of the previous year; but the gain of $44,910,000, or 
about 5 per cent. in the receipts is only in a small 
measure due to the expansion of the system. What it 
is mainly attributable to is the exceptional harvest of 1891, 
which furnished the companies with a big volume of 
traffic in the first half of 1892. Had it not been for this 
the results would unquestionably have been very 
different, for trade in the United States continued dull 
during a large portion of the year, especially in the 
Southern States, where the low value of cotton exercised 
a very adverse effect; and as a consequence, rates 
remained at a low level. And it is the lowness of 
rates that is largely responsible for the unsatisfactory 
character of the net revenue, which is made apparent from 
the limited number of returns that have been published. 
The companies, in fact, did a much larger amount of 
business, but at lower rates, and so far as net revenue was 
concerned the one influerce verylargely off-set the other. 
In addition, most of the leading lines expended an ex- 
ceptional amount upon ‘‘ betterments,” in order to prepare 
for the World’s Fair at Chicago, and hence but little 
extra was realised in the way of dividends. In the course 
of 1893 better results may be expected, for any accession 
of traffic is likely to be more profitable, and the ‘‘ better- 
ment” expenditure will probably be reduced. Still, 
investors—not speculators—will do well to exercise great 
caution ; for the prosperity of 1893, like that of 1892, will 
be wholly due to transitory influences, and has no bearing 
whatever upon the underlying conditions. 


The London Dock Companies.—It is satisfactory to 
observe that the working of the London and St Katharine 
and Kast and West India Docks, under the control of the 
London and India Joint Committee, continues to show 
improving results. In the second half of 1889, the year 
in which the joint working commenced, the profits, after 
meeting the interest charge of the Committee, were 
£155,912; in the corresponding period of 1890 they 
amounted to £186,072; in the second half of 1891 to 
£259,412 ; and in the closing half of 1892 they reached 
£271,616. The tonnage of shipping from foreign ports 
entering the docks during the six months shows an 
increase of 68,621 tons, the goods landed an increase of 
5,100 tons, and the goods in warehouse at the close of 
the half-year an increase of £22,360 tons. The com- 
mittee report that the augmentation in the tonnage 
entering the docks has been chiefly in the Atlantic 
trade ; but whilst this has yielded an improvement in 
import rates, on the other hand, the export rates have 
decreased generally, in consequence of the depression in 
trade. Under these circumstances, they say, every effort 
has been made to economise in the principal items of 
expenditure, ‘‘and this has not been without effect in 
producing results which it is hoped may be considered 
satisfactory.” The london and St Katharine Company 
is able to pay a dividend at the rate of 2} percent. per 
annum, making 2} per cent. for the year, as against 2 per 
cent. for 1891, and 1} per cent. for 1890 and 1889. The 
Kast and West India Com 
thing on its ordinary capital; but out of its share of the 
profits in the past half-year it is able to pay the full 
interest on the debenture issues, and also £12,831. or 
4 per cent., on account of the arrears of interest on the 
deferred debenture stock, leaving the arrears at £7,479. 
It will, therefore, be seen that if the rate of progress 
shown in the past half-year is continued, there will soon 
be a balance available for the ordinary shareholders In 
the past half-year the wages paid at the docks and ‘town 
warehouses amounted to £335,762, against £333,809 in 
the corresponding half of 1891; while the salaries

The Chilian Government and its Nitrate Properties.— 
The Chilian Legislature has now before it a Bill for the 
sale of the Government nitrate properties, which has 
received the approval of the Standing Committee of 
Finance. Of this measure the main provisions are thus 
summarised by the Chilian Times :—‘ No sale shall 
take place until after six months’ advertising in the 
Diario Oficial, and three months in London, Paris, and 
Berlin papers. The minimum price not to be under that 
paid by the Government plus interest at the rate of 
4} per cent. per annum from the date of acquirement to 
the day of sale. The price to be paid 50 per cent. down, 
and the remainder in two yearly instalments of 25 per 
cent. plus interest at the rate of 44 per cent. per annum. 
The purchasers to be allowed to anticipate the payments 
if they should choose to do so. The transfer of owner- 
ship to be made without recourse against the State, but 
the purchasers to have the right to apply to the courts 
with respect to boundaries and recovery of property. 
The President of the Republic not to be allowed 
to dispose of the proceeds of the sale except according 
to a special Bill to be passed for this purpose.” 
If the sale of these properties be determined upon, the 
existing nitrate producers will be placed in a somewhat 
difficult position. They have, as our readers know, 
entered into a combination to restrict the output so as to 
keep up prices. If, however, the Government properties 
are sold to other parties the supply will be increased, and 
the object of the combination defeated, while, on the 
other hand, if the existing companies acquire the new 
Government properties, they will be saddled with addi- 
tional capital and other expenses without any compensa- 
tory advantages, seeing that their producing power is 
already greater than the nitrate market offers scope for. 
That the combination is not looked upon with much 
favour in Chili will be evident from the following 
extract from a report which the Fiscal Delegate of the 
Nitrate Fields has presented to the Government :—‘‘The 
Chilian Government acquired (in 1887) 75 nitrate 
establishments, for the certificates representing which it 
paid the holders at the rate of £105 for each 1,000 soles. 
At the present time those establishments, comprising 
8,230 estacas (about 60,000 acres)—of which, perhaps, 
6,000 may be considered as ‘good ground’—represent, 
with interest and cost of keeping up and supervision, an 
investment of not less than 14 million pounds sterling. 
Therefore, each quintal of nitrate in the fiscal properties 
acquired by payment of the certificates is burdened with 
a prime cost (in the ground) of not less than 14d to 2d 
(on an average of 100,000 quintals per estaca). The prin- 
cipal existing nitrate esta blishments in Tarapaca are the 
property of foreign limited companies, mostly English. 
It is notorious that in the ‘course of the commer- 
cial transactions giving rise to their formation, the capita! 
necessary for bringing them into operation has been ex- 
cessively inflated. Thirteen of these companies, whose 
estates extend to 2,720 estacas, have been formed with a 
capital amounting to £4,250,000. From the 272 millions 
of quintals of nitrate theoretically contained in the above 
acreage, let us deduct 25 millions already extracted, and 
bear in mind that part of the ground does not contain 
caliche (raw nitrate). Supposing, then, the existence 
now of 200 millions of quintals of nitrate, we find that 
each quintal is burdened beforehand, for cost of land and 
machinery, with more than five pence, or, at the exchange 
of 18d, about 25 centavos of our currency. Individual 
cases could be cited of even higher cost. According to 
Sefior Billinghurst,* the estate of the Primitiva Com- 
pany does not contain more than 67 estacas of nitrate- |} 
bearing ground, for the exploitation of which a company 
was formed with a capital of £240,000. Each quintal of 
nitrate is therefore burdened before extraction with a 
cost of eight and a half-pence. Thia for the original 
shareholders, whilst the shares of the company after- 
wards exceeded seven or eight times their nominal value.”

The Bank has parted on balance with 44,685,431 
(£1,787,417) of its gold, which has gone into the circula- 
tion. None of the 161 millions (£6,440,000) lost by the 
Bank on the fortnight has been exported, but some con- 
signments have been made to Vienna of foreign goid 
received from London. There is again a large decrease 
in the note issue, which is now reduced 188 million franes 
(£7,520,000) below the limit. That situation confirms 
the views of those who, like M. Léroy-Beaulieu, con- 
sidered that an increase in the limit to 4,000 millions 
(£160,000,000) was unnecessary. The Bill to permit the 
Bank to make the inerease has been voted by the Senate, 
after the Chamber of Deputies, but has not yet been 
promulgated, and the law will perhaps be reserved until 
a necessity for the increase arises. The London exchange 
has remained firm, with an improvement of a-half centime 
on last week’s rate, at 25f 124c. The rouble exchange 
is, however, 14 centimes lower, at 2f56c. Private dis- 
count is easier, at 2} per cent. The cash reserve in 
to-day’s return was composed as under :—

Relative to the decrease of 117 millions (£4,680,000) 
in the gold at the Bank of France, shown in the balance- 
sheet issued last week, a note of evidently official origin 
describes the movement of that metal at the Bank be- 
tween January 12th—the day on which the limit of the 
note issue was reached—and the 19th, the date of the 
following weekly return. During that period the Bank 
paid out 97 million franes (£3,880,000) of gold in Paris, 
and 64 millions (£2,560,000) at its provincial branches ; 
together, 161 millions (£6,440,000). On the other hand, 
the Bank received from the circulation 26 millions 
(£1,040,000) in Paris, and 17 millions (£680,000) in the 
branches; also one million of French gold from London ; 
total, 44 millions (£1,760,000), which, deducted from 
the payments out, left the decrease of 117 millions 
(£4,680,000). 

The French Treasury ceased nearly two years back to 
issue short-dated bills—that is to say, at three to eleven 
months—but continued to sell bills at one year at 2 per 
cent. interest. In September last it suspended the issue 
of those also, the last instalment of the loan of 1891 
having been then recently paid. The Treasury is now 
more bare of money, as a limit is fixed to its use of savings 
banks deposits, and a notice has been issued that it has 
resumed the issue of bills at four months’ date, with 
interest at 2 per cent. per annum. 

The bourse has been firm during the week, but prices 
to-day, French Threes excepted, were not quite at their 
best. Crédit Foncier shares recovered to 1,000f, but 
that rate was not maintained. Egyptian Unified has, on 
the other hand, recovered } from its lowest price. 
Other foreign funds have also been weak. Russian issues 
have, however, maintained their ground, excepting Paper 
Fives, which went back on a relapse in the rouble 
exchange. Spanish Exterior has declined 17j¢ on the 
week, to 60f 85¢c; Portuguese Threes, 30c, to 21f 80c; 
Russian Consols have improved 20c, at 97f 20c; and 
Gold Threes, 15c, at 78f 40c. Paper Fives are 30c lower, 
at 66f 80c. 


eee 














A case of administrative intolerance towards an 
English merchant recently occurred at Nantes. The 
French Government required 1,100 tons of Cardiff coal 
for its establishments at Indret, and invited tenders for 
the supply. The conditions contained no restriction as 
to the nationalities of the parties tendering, and an 
Englishman, Mr Davies, sent in an offer, which, being 
the lowest, was duly accepted. At the sitting of the 
board charged to receive the tenders, one of the unsuc- 
cessful candidates raised a question of the nationality of 
Mr Davies, lit the president declined to entertain it, re- 
marking that as English coal was required, it was only 
natural that it should be supplied by an English 
firm. The contract was signed, subject, as usual, 
to the approval of the Minister of Marine, which is 
generally a mere formality, and Mr Davies deposited the 
guarantee money required. Some days later he received 
a notice from the Minister of Marine, then M. Burdeau, 
informing him that his contract had been cancelled, with- 
out assigning any reason. As, however, a fresh notice 
inviting tenders for the supply was advertised at the 
same time, with the condition that they would only be 
received from French firms, the motive for the exclusion 
of Mr Davies is evident. The right of the Government 
to reserve its orders for Frenchmen is incontestable, but 
as no such condition was inserted in the cahier des charges, 
Mr Davies appears to have just cause to consider himself 
unfairly treated. 

The traffic returns of the great French railway com- 
panies for 1892 show, compared with 1891, a small de- 
crease in the mileage and also in the gross receipts, with 
the exception of the Orleans and Western companies, 
due to the reduction in the passenger and parcels rates 
since the Ist April. The Orleans Company, with an in- 
crease of 2,206,188f in the earnings, loses 1°19 per cent. 
on the mileage; the Western gains 100,842f on the one 
hand, and loses 4°41 per cent. on the other. The Lyons 
has a deficit of 2,981,490f, or 2-12 per cent. ; the Northern 
937,000f, or 0°9 per cent. ; the Eastern 353,000f, or 2°91 
per cent.; the Southern 471,462f, or 1:37 per cent. The 
South of Austria Company gained 25,384f on a total of 
100 millions ; the Austrian State lines lost 5,136,422f on 
a total of 61 millions in 1891; the Madrid to Saragessa 
2,865,866f, or 5 percent. ; the North of Spain 1,741,161f, 
or 2°78 per cent. ; the Portuguese Royal Company gained 
122,894f, or 22 per cent., on its guaranteed lines, and lost 
640,199f, or 4 per cent.,on the non-guaranteed ; the 
Asturias Company gained 154,126f, or 1 per cent. The 
returns of the Meridional of Italy Company show a total 
decrease of 1,532,402f on the principal network, and of 
63,176f on the secondary lines. 


French trade in December last showed some consider- 
able variations on the same month of the previous year, 
due to special causes. The total imports declined from 475 
million franes in 1891 to 403 millions in 1892. In the 
former period they were increased by the haste to get in 
merchandise before the application of the new tariff a 
month later. The imports of food then amounted to 
170 millions, from the large arrivals of wine and dried 
fruits especially, and in 1892 dropped to 108 millions. 
Manufactures also declined from 81 millions in 1891 to 
52 millions last year. The exports fell on the month

UNITED STATES. 
‘(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) 


New York, January 14. 


The foreign exchange market at New York is higher, 
but there is less tendency on the part of gold to go 
abroad since the Bank of France has ceased offering any 
premium for it. The local money market has been 
easier, with a pressure of loanable funds. In Wall Street 
there has been a rise, in large part the result of 
a bull movement, though to some extent based on 
reasonable suppositions as to the situation, present and 
sy 00 The leading feature is Manhattan, which 

as jumped within two weeks from 115 to 174, the gain 
this week being 20 points. This rise, engineered by a large 
clique of professional operators, is due almost directly to 
‘what appears to be the failure of the Rapid Transit Com- 
mission to devise a successful competing method of 
rapid transit for New York City. In any event, the 
-outlook now is that the Rapid Transit Commission will 
suggest extensions or improvements, or both, to the 
Manhattan Elevated people, and, as a result, the 
Manhattan property will attain a degree of pros- 
perity not anticipated. This, at least, is the view 
-of those who have been operating for a rise in 
Mahattan and there isnot a little init. Reading stock 
was depressed about 1} points early in the week, but 
subsequently recovered a portion of this fall, which was 
all the more noteworthy as it occurred in the face of a 
‘declaration of 5 per cent. interest on all classes of pre- 
ference bonds. An unfavourable view was taken at first 
of the recent change in Reading, because the company had 
earned a surplus of only $246,000, because it has borrowed 
heavily, aird because of the result of legal action by the 
State of New Jersey requiring Jersey Central to leave the 
Reading Combination. The latter has been accomplished, 
and Jersey Central is now standing on its own feet, with 
an application to Court on the part of the State of 
New Jersey in order to find out whether the dissolution 
so far as the Jersey Central is concerned, is actual or 


||.apparent. All this of course tended to depress 


Reading stock, but the publication of Reading’s report, 
and increased sales of coal greatly stimulated by low 
temperature, together with reacticn in the opinion of 





{| Operators, all tended to advance quotations again, so 


that at the close of this week there does not appear to be 
much change as compared with a week ago. 

Higher prices have been scored during the past week 
by wheat, corn, oats, pork, sugar, leather, whisky, and 
live hogs. The advance in cereals is owing largely to 
checked Geliveries from farmers, due to the cold weather, 
as well as to an improved demand at home and from 
abroad. The spring orders for boots and shoes are 
behind the advance in leather, and the gain in the price 
| of whisky is purely artificial or speculative. But prices 


third of the usual crop at this season. It will be noted 
from the last statement that the corner in pork at 
Chicago, concerning which so much outcry has been made, 


| 
of hogs have advanced normally on a shortage of about one- 
| 


{| is based upon agood solid economic foundation. Pittsburgh 


and St Louis report lower prices on ordinary grades of pig 
iron, where sales have been made, and print cloths in 
New England have lost }c. Cotton prices have eased 
off a little on free deliveries at the South, a large visible 
supply to date, the continuation of the strike in Lanca- 
shire, together with reduced demand from France, owing 
to troubles there. 


favourably affected by the extremely cold weather of the 
past fortnight, with the possible exception of re-orders 
-of woollens, clothing, shoes, &c. At this time commercial 
travellers are again seeking the road, and it will not be 
more than two weeks before something of the nature of 
spring trade may be learned. 

Bank clearings each week thus far during the current 
year have tended to fall slightly behind corresponding 
totals for 1892; but if in this one finds something to 


regret, it may, on the other hand, be noted that the | 


business failures each week in 1893 continue to fall 
hehind like records for 1892. 
-Reports of gress earnings of railways throughout the

Trade in general throughout the country has been un- 


country for 1892 aggregate about 515 million dollars, 
which is 5 per cent. more than the same roads earned 
gross in 1891. When the small increase of gross earnings 
in recent months of 1892, compared with 1891, are con- 
sidered, the fact that the year 1892 shows an increase of 
5 per cent. over the preceding year constitutes a fairly 
satisfactory report. The heaviest gain was made by the 
Granger roads, about 12 per cent. more than in 1891. 
Eastern roads made the next largest increase, about 7 
per cent., while the companies operating in the South- 
West rank third, with an increase of 5 per cent. over 
1891. Fourth in order are the Southern railroads, which 
position they share with the Pacific roads, each system 
gaining 3°6 per cent. as compared with 1891, while the 
trunk lines bring up the rear of the procession with a 
gain of only 2:7 per cent. as compared with the year 
before. 





GERMANY. 
(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) 
BERLIN, January 25. 

The market does not appear to be in a very cheerful 
condition ; on the contrary, the aspect is less encouraging 
just now than it was about a week ago. The bulls do not 
dare to move, because they see that the public are not 

ery eager to support them. 

One day quotations were put down for no better reason 
than because the Committee of the Stock Exchange had 
not approved at once of, but asked for someslight alteration 
in, the prospectus of the Hungarian conversions.. When it 
got known afterwards that the prospectus had been ap- 
proved of, affairs began again to look bright. The prospectus 
will shortly be published. The transaction is the issue 
of nominally 1,062 millions crowns 4 per cent. Hungarian 
Rente for the conversion of the 5 per cent. silver loans 
and shares at the price of 92°50 per cent. All the par- 
ticulars of the operation are known to your readers. The 
operation will not be completed until about February 7th. 
Subscriptions are received here by the Disconto-Gesells- 
chaft, and by Messrs Bleichroeder. Another prospectus 
refers to the issue of nominally 18 millions florins 4 per 
cent. Hungarian Gold Rente for the conversion of the 5 
and 6 per cent. bonds. Subscriptions will be received at 
the price of 96:20 per cent. by the Disconto-Gesellschaft, 
Messrs Bleichroeder, the Darmstadt Bank, and Messrs 
Mendelssohn and Co. 

Yesterday and to-day the market was rather quiet, 
and betokened a good deal of cautious reserve. Doubtful 
reports as to the much-spoken of coal syndicate 
helped to produce this depression. There was, how- 
ever, some animated business in railway stock. Gott- 
hard, Warsaw, Vienna, and many others declined, 
owing to the news as to snow-blocks on the lines. The 
market for bank shares does not show any particular 
features. There is enough of business in Credit and 
Disconto-Comandit shares, but the fluctuations do not 
amount to much. Mining shares began to weaken, but 
they again became stronger when it got known that the 
convention of South German Rolling Mills had abandone«! 
the idea of reducing prices. Navigation shares are 





manifestly less firm, owing to reports from Washington. | 


The market for Funds is quiet, but firm. Mexicans go 
on improving, and it is evident that they are well 
supported by powerful parties. Italians have become 
firmer again after some wavering, due to the scandalous 
news concerning the Italian banks. Hungarians are in 
a good position. Business in Russian loans and notes is 
very limited, though one might expect better from the 
reports as to progress in the negotiations for a treaty 
with Russia. What these reports are worth no one can 
tell. But it is at least known that on Monday the Com- 
mission appointed by the Government held a sitting. In 
any case, it is absolutely necessary in this matter to pre- 
pare for surprises either one way or the other. We may 
witness a satisfactory result rapidly arrived at, or we may 
witness a failure—or rather a postponement, for Russian 
diplomacy is strongly attached to the maxim “ always 
negotiate.” For the present our politicians seem to lean 
towards the probability that a treaty will come out of all 


| this. The agrarian members of the Reichstag have been 


making long speeches on the matter, in which they asked 














ee niin ini 
tiene 


106 THE ECONOMIST. 


the Minister for Agriculture, in a threatening tone, to do 
his utmost in order to prevent the signature of a com- 
mercial treaty with Russia. The argument of these men 
is that a treaty with Russia would ruin German agricul- 
ture. This is quite sufficient to show how incompatible 
the interests of the agrarian party are with the general 
interests of the nation. To the latter an advantageous 
commercial treaty with Russia is of absolute necessity, 
as was clearly shown in Parliament by the eloquent 
speeches of the advocates of the treaty. In passing I 
may refer to the general opinion which exists that should 
a treaty be obtained, the Imperial Bank would be allowed 
to resume its advances on Russian loans. 

The Royal Seehandlung, which may be regarded as 
a sort of Government bank, has published its usual 
report for 1892. The total amount of transactions is 
reported at 4,013.80 million marks (£200,690,000), against 
2,706.57 million marks (£135,328,500) in 1891. The 
profit amounts to 1,799,095 marks (£89,950), against 
1,719,976 (£86,000) in 1891, which is an increase of 
5094 per cent. in the capital of 33°89 million marks 
(£1,694,500), against 5-075 per cent, in 1891. The profit 
would have been greater but for the lozses incurred in 
the stock department. 

The official annual report as to the sugar trade shows 
an increase of sugar production to the extent of 924,992 
kilogs above the total of 1891. The imports of foreign 
sugar declined during the last five months of the past 
year, and the sugar exports have also declined consi- 
derably. 

Some importance was attached to the visit of the 
Roumanian Ministers to this capital. It is generally and 
credibly supposed that the visit is not altogether alien to 
the pending negotiations for a commercial treaty. 

A lately published statistical report on Italian finances 
mentions that out of the 97} million lire (£3,890,000) 
which Italy pays annually to foreign holders of her loans 
(about one-third of her total payments), 32 4-5 million 
lire (£1,312,000) go to Germany. According to this, 
Germany would not be so far behind France, who 
receives annually about 434 million lire (£1,740,000) 
from Italy. It is known that investments in Italian 
loans go on at an increasing rate in this country. 

A number of leading machine makers have just estab- 
lished a limited liability company, ‘Technical Office of 
German Machine Makers,” in Hamburg, with the object 
of pushing the exports of machines. 

The cities of Frankfort-on-the-Main and Wiesbaden 
are, it is said, to be connected by a new railway line, 
which, owing to a more direct route, is to be 7 kilometres 
shorter than the present one. If this report be true, the 
interests of the Taunus Railway will of course be 
affected. 

Since the many reports as to the projected reconstruc- 
tion of the coal syndicate in Westphalia have much effect 
on the market for coal shares, I cannot always avoid 
mentioning them, though they are often of an unfounded 
character. At present it does not seem at all as if the 
syndicate will be reconstructed, the opposition still re- 
maining strong. One of the Parliamentary representa- 
tives of the owners of coal mines, Mr Hammacher, availed 
himself of the discussion on the naval estimates in the 
Reichstag to blame the Secretary of the Navy for using 
English coal instead of giving preference to the home 
article. The Secretary of the Navy, Vice-Admiral Holl- 
mann, replied that he had, indeed, bought 27,000 tons of 
coal from England, and he had thereby saved 90,000 marks 
(£4,500). English coal in Kiel is 4-25 marks cheaper than 
Westphalian coal. The Parliamentary debate on this 
point is interesting, because it seems to indicate‘a softening 
of the extreme Protectionist views once adopted on such 
occasions by the representatives of the Government. 

Reports from the Rhine state that the vintage of 1892 
has not responded to the sanguine hopes regarding it. The 
quality is good, and obtained high prices, but noi up to 
expecta tion. 

The production of pig-iron in this country (including 
Luxemberg) during the year 1892 is stated at 4,793,000 
tons, against 4,452,019 tons in 1891. 

The official report as to German foreign trade in 1892 | 
has now appeared. It gives the following items :— | 












(January 28, 1893. 


1892. 1891. 
Marks. Marks. 
Value of imports ......... 4,463,093,000 ... 4,403,404,000

Value of exports ......... 3,327,990,000 339,755, 
c (£166,399,000) £166,988,000) 


In 1892 the value of the imports exceeded that of the ex- 
ports by 1,135 million marks. Theexcess was 1,068 million 
marks in 1891, 863 million marks in 1899, 833 million 
marks in 1889, 83 million marks in 1888. Prior to that 
year the surplus was on the side of the exports over 
imports; 13 million marks in 1887, 107 million marks in 
1886. ; 

The ports in the Baltic are to have specially cheap 
freight rates for the carriage of grain from Galicia. __ 

The Reichstag has been the scene of an animated dis- 
cussion as to the proposed increase of the taxes m stock 
transactions. Mr Siemens won the laurels of the day in 
a speech, in which he proved that the proposed taxes 
would work to the injury of business, The taxes in 
question yielded 5 million marks (£250,000) in 1885, 72 
million marks in 1886, 7°9 million marks in 1887, and 
11 million marks in 1891. It is now proposed to raise 
the yield to 12 million marks (£600,000) at the present 
rate of business. The yield would be larger in better 
times. It is probable that it is not so much the prospect 
of the actual payment of this tax, but the impression 
that heavier taxation may follow, which has exercised 
such a depressing effect on the market. 

The Prussian Budget for 1891-2 showed a deficit of 
42 million marks (£2,100,000); the Budge’ for 1893-4 
estimates the deficiency at about 58 million marks 
(£2,900,000). The loans which will be raised on account 
of the German Empire and Prussia will probably be 
issued next month, and are expected to amount 
altogether to from 180 to 200 million marks (9 to 10 
millions sterling). ; 

The official report shows that emigration from this 
country has been as follows :—In 1892 there were 112,208 
emigrants; in 1891, 115,392; in 1890, 91,925; in 
1889, 90,259 ; in 1888, 98,515; and in 1887, 99,712.

shares, with the single exception of the Five per cent. In the compilation of this table care has been taken to 


make comparisons on a fair basis. Owners’ wagons being 
used very little in America and Holland, I have not 
quoted Class A as the lowest for England; on the other 
hand, the official differential rate of the Trunk lines and 
the special rates made by Dutch railways are taken no 
account of either. At the same time I must point to the 
well-known fact that English railways frequently go 
below the official maximum whenever they think it advis- 
able to do so. 

Nevertheless, the table leads to the following deduc- 
tions :— . ' 

1. Although Holland has to import its fuel from abroad 
(England, Germany, and Belgium), and although most of 
its locomotives are built in this country, the maximum 
rates on the Dutch railways, whose tariffs must be 
approved of by the Government, are from 50 to 70 per 
cent. lower than those of the London and North-Western 
Railway. 

Although fuel, iron, and labour are dearer in the 
United States than here, the American railway, in spite 
of its inferior roadbed, hauls freight over a distance of 
about 950 miles for about the same money as the peer 


Hungarian and Austrian Note Rente, which are at a 
standstill, show a more or less considerable rise. 
Shares of the Anglo Bank rose from 153 to 154.75; of the 
Hungarian Credit Bank, from 365.25 to 368; of the Credit 
Anstalt, from 318 to 322.25; Bankverein, 117 to 118.50; 
Union Bank, from 243.75 to 249.50; Austrian Boden 
Credit Anstalt, from 392 to 397; Liinderbank, from 
231.80 to 236.90; Alpine Iron Works, from 53.50 to

Karl Ludwig Railway, from 218.50 to 219.25; Austrian

108 THE ECONOMIST. (January 28, 1893. 
i a 


emong English roads charges for a distance of 258 miles, 
or for less than one-third of the distance. 

A few additional facts, which do not appear from the 
above table, tend to show what this difference in rates 
means. There are no exact statistics showing the 
average freight rate in this country ; but it it is stated 
by various authorities to amount to from 1}d to 14d per 
ton-mile. In the United States, Mr Poor says, it is 
(1891) less than a halfpenny (0°929c). In Holland it 
was about 1887, when Mr Jeans wrote his “ Railway 
Problem,” 0°76d ; which means that, assuming 1}d to be 
the,average English rate, our public paid in i891 about 
£17,500,000 more than they would have done if the 
average rate had been no higher here than in Holland ; 
and they would have paid fully £25,500,000 less had our 
iron roads been able to serve the public at the average 
American rate. 

This difference is so great that, in my opinion, it calls 
either for explanation or for a thorough investigation. 
Perhaps this letter may be instrumental in bringing 
about one or the other. At any rate, it offers plenty of 
food for reflection to those who incline to the view that 
the best railway is that which renders the best service 
at the lowest cost, and that the principles upon which 
our railways conduct their traffic are not in every respect 
calculated to promote the interests of the community 
they serve.—I am, Sir, yours faithfully, 

S. F. Van Oss.

“To my goldsmith to bid him look out for some gold 
for me; and he tells me that ginnys, which I bought 


now cost me 22d; and but very few to be had at any 
price. However, some more I will have, for they are 
very convenient and of easy disposal.” 


November 12th, 1666. 
“This day I received 450 pieces of gold more of Mr 
Stokes, but cost me 223d change. But I am well con- 
tented with it, I having now nearly £2,800 in gold, and 
will not rest till I get full £3,000.” 
May 17th, 1667. 
“To Sir R. Viner’s with 600 pieces of gold to turn into 
silver for the enabling me to answer Sir G, Carteret’s 
£3,000, which he now draws all out of my hand towards 
the paying for a purchase he hath made for his son and 
my Lady Jemimah, in Northamptonshire.” 
N.B.—No mention of difficulty in getting silver, and 
Mr Pepys, from the fact of his changing his gold, lately 
bought, would appear to have found advantage in 
doing so.

bombarded Sheerness, and being anchored in the 
Thames).

sold for 24 and 25s a-piece.”’

clusion that the country bankers, and _ particularly 
some of the new great amalgamations, advance money 
pretty freely, either on no security at all, or on 
very inadequate security. In London an avowedly open 
advance would be difficult to find in our great joint-stock 
banks, but in the country we seem fast to be coming 
to a very different state of things. I merely note this as 
explaining the apparent greater prosperity of country 
banks for the time. Of course, running heavier risks, 
they can get greater profits, but it is a strange anomaly 
if country shops are to be carried on on bank credits, 
while in London so different a state of things exists. 
Whether the great metropolitan institutions will be driven 
by the plethora of cash and the consequert low value of 
loanable capital to follow the country example remains to 
be seen. As it is, they no doubt advance pretty freely on 
securities or warrants of the real value of which they

The amount of the “ other deposits,” compared with the “ other 
securities,” showed in 1883 an excess of £3,108,367; in 1890, an 
excess of £2,167,636; in 1891, an excess of £1,132,824; and 
in 1892 an excess of £2,262,572, In 1893 there is an excess of 
£5,940,426. 

In 1890, the Stock Exchange settlement corresponding to the one 
just arranged lead to a strong demand for money. Floating money 
was quoted as high as 64 per cent., in spite of artificial relief 
afforded to the market by the import of Russian gold. Foreign 
withdrawals of gold were proceeding. On the Stock Exchange the 
tone was improving, with a fair amount of business. Contango rates 
at the settlement ruled high. 

In 1891, although the revenue collection was transferring money 
from the outside market to the Bank, such was the ease that the 
Bank rate had to be further reduced to 3 per cent. Meantime gold 
was being withdrawn for abroad in considerable amounts. Or the 
Stock Exchange business was dull. The railway dividend declara- 
tions had but little effect upon prices. 

In 1892, the Bank had lost strength following a reduction of its 
rate. On the Stock Exchange foreign securities were weak, owing 
to the critical condition of Portuguese finance, and the difficulties 
of trust companies holding South American stocks. American 
railroads improved on the virtual settlement of the dispute with 
Chili.

THE STOCK MARKETS. 


Business on the Stock Exchange during the past week 
has been interrupted by the arrangement of the settlement. 
This, however, has not caused much difficulty, owing to the 
ease of money and the lightness of the rates that have pre- 
vailed. Home Government securities have gained firmness 
with the progress of the week ; British Railways have been 
firm generally, the dividend declarations being either equal 
to or better than the market expectations ; American Rail- 
roads have been irregular, and Foreign Government securi- 
ties have been depressed. The change in the Bank rate had 
but small effect upon prices. 

It is officially notified that Mr Walter W. Daw was to-day 
(Friday) declared a defaulter upon the Stock Exchange. 


Home and Colonial Government Securities.—The Funds 
were flat, and a little depressed earlier in the week, but they 
soon brightened up, and the reduction in the Bank rate has 
had a strengthening tendency. Since last Friday Consols 
for both money and account show an advance of }, and all 
other high-class securities were higher. They were particu- 
larly favourably affected by the success which attended the 
issue of the Mauritius loan. Local Loans stock, Egyptian 
Government Guaranteed stock, and all the principal Corpo- 
ration securities rose on the announcement of the result of 
the tendering.

British Railways. — The dividend declarations have 
exerted the principal influence over the Railway market 
during the past week, but the fact that continuation rates 
were so light, especially on the heavy lines, caused firmness, 
Of the dividends, that of the North-Eastern Company, 
declared last night after business hours, has had the most 
favourable effect, North-Eastern Consols having to-day 
(Friday) risen 2} per cent. Lancashire and Yorkshire stock 
also benefited in a minor degree at the time of the dividend 
declaration, but in the case of Metropolitan District and 
South-Western the rate declared was pretty much what was 
expected, and the announcement had little or no effect upon 
prices. Brighton A’s fell sharply after the chairman’s speech 
at the meeting, but have since recovered. The discontinuation 
of the publication of daily traffics seems to have had an

appreciable effect in steadying the prices in the latter part of 
the week. The principal continuation rates in the Home Rail- 
way department were as follows :—Brighton Deferred and

RAILWAY TRAFFIC RECEIPTS. 


The traffic receipts on the principal railways of the United 
Kingdom for the week ending Jan. 22 are given above, together 
with the increase or decrease in receipts and the mileage in opera- 
tion as compared with the corresponding week in 1892. The 
Scotch railways are given separately, since their aggregate receipts 
are calculated from the 1st August instead of from 1st January, 
as in the case of the English and Irish railways. 

The increase of £6,912 for the week on the English and Irish 
lines is equal to 0°6 per cent., the mileage being 14,090} as com- 
pared with 13,9944 in the corresponding week of last year, while the 
increase of £2,435 on the Scotch lines is equal to 1,80 per cent., on 
a mileage of 2,266}, against 2,229. 

The aggregate totals show on the English and Irish lines a de- 
crease of £64,406, equal to 20 per cent., and on the Scotch lines an 
increase of £49,255, equal to 1:3 per cent., as compared with the 
corresponding period of 1892.

Foreign Government Securities.—The movements in the 
Foreign market on the week are mostly downwards. Argen- 
tines have been especially depressed, although there wassome 
slight recovery immediately after the meeting of External 
bondholders on Wednesday. The leading features have been 
the relapse of Greek bonds, the flatness of Portuguese in con- 
nection with the Ministerial statement as to the settlement 
of the debt and the debate in the Cortes, and the variations 
in Egyptians in connection with the political trouble there, 
The following were the continuation rates on the 
principal foreign securities:—Spanish Fours, yy back

American Railroads.— In the American department 
movements have been irregular, and dealings quite without 
feature, except that they have been constantly under the 
influence of the fears of further gold shipments. On 
ba'ance compared with last Friday, however, the majority 
of prices show some advance. The settlement was a light 
one, the continuation rates being 3 to 4 per cent. generally.

Mining and Miscellaneous Shares—Business in the 
Mining market has been confined almost entirely to the 
settlement, and prices in no department show an appreciable 
change. In the Miscellaneous market, likewise, transactions 


have been limited, only a few of the very soundest descrip- 
tions having been dealt in to any extent.

Hotices and Reports. 


RAILWAY COMPANIES 

BARRY.—The directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 9 
per cent., carrying forward £1,969. 

CITY AND SOUTH LONDON.—The report for the half-year ended 
December 31st states that the receipts from all sources amounted 
to £22,652, and the cost of working to £15,389. Inclusive of the 
balance brought forward the net revenue account shows an aggre- 
gate total of £8,304. After making provision for debenture and 
debenture stock interest, a balance remains available for dividend 
of £4,045. The directors recommend the full dividend of 5 per 
cent. per annum on the preference shares, and a dividend at the 
rate of g per cent. per annum on the consolidated ordinary stock, 
leaving £822 to be carried forward. The number of passengers 
conveyed, exclusive of season ticket holders, was 3,217,602, showing 
an increase of 468,547. Difficulties with the local authorities 
have, it is stated, delayed the the commencement of the much 
needed siding accommodation at Stockwell station, forming part of 
the Clapham extension line, but it is hoped that these works will 
very shortly be started. The conversion of the terminal debentures 
into eithei 4 per cent. perpetual debenture stock or 5 per cent. per- 
petual preference shares is progressing satisfactorily, and will result 
in a considerable saving of interest to the company. A resolution 
for the conversion into consolidated ordinary stock of the remaining 
3,000 ordinary shares already issued will be submitted to the 
special meeting to be held at the conclusion of the half-yearly 
meeting. 

_ GREAT EASTERN.—The accounts for the past half year show an 
increase in gross revenue of £53,766, and an addition to expendi- 
ture of £51,483. The continental earnings have been materially 
affected by the cholera epidemic, The passenger traffic from Ham- 
burg has been discontinued for many months, and the Rotterdam 
and Antwerp passenger traffic showsa serious decline, and has only 
lately resumed its usual proportions. The working expenses have 
again increased in various departments ; and the amounts for com- 
pensation for personal injury show a large addition to the usual 
charges under that head, in consequence of past accidents. The 
condition of the districts served by the railway has been preju- 
diciaily affected by the bad harvest of 1892, and the low prices of 
areca The new rates now charged have, in some instances, 

een severely criticised ; but the directors, in conjunction with other 


railway companies, are desirious vf meting the traders as far as 
they can.

January 28, 1893.] 


HULL AND BARNSLEY.—The accounts for the past half-year do not 
— of the payment of a dividend on the ordinary stock, but a 

lance of £5,276 is carried forward. At the corresponding period 
last year a distribution at the rate of # per cent. per annum was 
made, and £2950 was carried forward. 

LANCASHIRE AND YORKSHIRE.—The directors recommend a 
dividend for the past half-year at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, 
carrying forward about £21,000. 

LONDON AND BLACKWALL.—The report for the half-year ending 
December 31 recommends a dividend at the usual rate of £4 10s per 
cent. per annum, payable on February 8. The directors recommend 
the adoption of the Forged Transfers Acts, and to charge a fee of 
= - every £25, or part of £25, nominal amount of stock trans- 

erred. 

LONDON AND SOUTH-WESTERN.—The company recommend a divi- 
dend for the half-year ended December 31, 1892, at the rate of 7? per 
cent. per annum on the original ordinary stock, the full dividend at 
the rate of 4 per cent. perannum for the half-year on the preferred con- 
verted ordinary stock, and 2 per cent. for the whole year on the de- 
ferred converted ordinary stock. The dividend of 7? per cent, on 
the ordinary stock is the same as that paid for the corresponding 
period of 1891, andthe balance of net revenue carried forward is 
£22,462, as compared with £17,192. 

LONDON, TILBURY, AND SOUTHEND.—The report states that the 
gross receipts for the half-year ending December 31 last amount to 
£143,398, against £136,377; the gross expenses to £74,152, against 
£66,424; and the net result is a profit balance of £69,246, against 
£69,953 for the corresponding half-year of 1591. After providing for 
rent and for interest on debenture stock, the balance of net revenue 
is £53,208. This sum enables the directors, after providing for 
preferential charges, to recommend a dividend on the ordinary stock 
for the past half-year at the rate of £5 5s percent. per annum, 
leaving a balance of £713 to be carried forward. The dividend for 
the corresponding period of 1891 was at the rate of £5 10s per cent. 
per annum, and a balance of £1,610 was carried over. In conse- 
quence of the action of the Great Eastern Railway Company in 
abolishing second-class carriages on their railway, the board have 
found it necessary to follow a similar course, and the operation will 
be completed on the whole system on March 31 next. The direc tors 
recommend the adoption of the Forged Transfers Act, and have 
also decided not to make any charge.

The report states that the competition between the rival omnibus 
companies, at fares which it is impossible for the heavily-taxed 
underground railways to compete with, has seriously affected the 
company’s local receipts. The directors hope that thé disastrous 
effect upon the omnibus companies themselves will lead to a wiser 
policy. The directors further state that the agreement for the 
interchange of trains on the inner circle, which expired in June 
last, has not been renewed, though the District Company have been 
frequently asked to formulate proposals. The present arrangements 
are being continued until June next, pending negotiations, They 
recommend a dividend for the half-year at the rate of 3j per cent. 
per annum on the ordinary stock, and the usual 24 per cent. for 
the half-year on surplus lands stock, and that £9,807 be carried 
forward. The board also recommend the adoption of the Forged 
Transfers Acts, making no extra charge for transfer fees under 
these Acts. 

METROPOLITAN DISTRICT.—The directors announce a distribution 
upon the Five per Cent. Preference Stock for the past half-year at 
the rate of 2} per cent. per annum, carrying forward £594. At the

Stock was at the rate of 2} per cent., and £1,076 was carried 
forward.

ber 31 last, subject to final audit, show a balance which will admit

rate of 6} per cent. per annum. For the second half of 1891 the 
dividend was at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum. 

NORTH LONDON.—The accounts admit of a dividend on the ordi- 
nary stock of 74 per cent per annum (the same rate as in the 
corresponding period of 1891), carrying forward about £1,850. 

TAFF VALE.—A dividend for the half-year at the rate of 3} per 
cent. per annum is recommended, carrying £6,000 forward to reserve, 
and carrying forward a balance of £5,000.

8UN LIFE.—The actuary’s report states that the valuation period 
of four and a-half years from June 24, 1887, shows a remarkable 
growth of the new assurances, attaining to upwards of one million 
per annum in 1890 and 1891, the passing of the new Act of Parlia- 
ment, the absorption of the business of the Sovereign, the abandon- 
ment of the Carlisle Table of Mortality in favour of the more 
scientific tables of the Institute of Actuaries, and the declaration 
of a bonus to all participating policies in existence throughout the 
period avéraging a return of upwards of £39 in cash for every £100 
received in premiums thereunder. This success, it is stated, has 
enabled the society, amongst other concessions for the current quin- 
quennium, “ to increase the value of its contracts by making claims 
under all policies payable immediately upon satisfactory proof of

not only the 2 per cent. dividend on the debenture stock fur the 
half-year, and the 2 per cent. on the deferred debenture stock, but 
to give a further 4 per cent. towards clearing off the arrears of 
interest due on that deferred debenture stock. ‘This will leave only 
about as much again of arrears to pay off, after which the ordinary 
stock will again have a chance of receiving some dividend— 
assuming, i.e., that the prosperity of the Port of London continues, 
which is not improbable.” 

LONDON ROAD CAR.—The directors recommend a dividend for the 
half-year ended December 31 at the rate of 44 per cent. per annum, 
carrying forward £539. 

LONDON STREET TRAMWAYS—The report for the half-year ended 
December 31st shows a revenue balance of £11,197. The directors 
propose to set aside £2,000 to repairs and renewal account and'£350 
to horse renewal account, and recommend a dividend of 5 per cent. 
per annum, free of tax, leaving £1,097 to be carried forward. The 
arbitration between the company and the London County Council 
with reference to the purchase of tramways authorised by the Act 
of 1870 has been proceeded with; the evidence is concluded, and 
the parties are now awaiting for the arbitrator’s award. 

NORTH METROPOLITAN TRAMWAYS.—The company in their report 
for the half-year ended December 31, state that the gross receipts 
amounted to £227,091, and the total expenditure to £177,234. The 
balance, £49,857, together with £2,781 brought forward, is carried 
to the net revenue account, and the sum available for division, 
after providing for debenture interest, is £47,257. Out of this it is 
proposed to pay a dividend at the rate of 74 per cent. per annum, 
being 7s 6d per share on the 110,923 fully paid-up shares, subject to 
deduction of income-tax, £5,661 being carried forward. 

ORIENTAL BANK ESTATES.—The directors do not contemplate 
declaring an interim dividend in the present year on either class of 
its shares, preferred or ordinary, owing to the shortness of crops in 
Mauritius and Ceylon. 

ROYAL AQUARIUM SOCIETY.— After paying prior charges, the avail- 
able balance for the past half-year is £9,246. It is proposed to pay 
a dividend of 3s 6d per share. This will leave £2,246 to be carried 


forward. 
MINING COMPANIES. 

BROKEN HILL PROPRIETARY.—The company have received a 
cablegram, dated Melbourne, 25th inst., announcing a dividend of 
2s per share, amounting to £96,000 on the 960,000 shares, payable in 
London and Melbourne on February 22. 

JUMPER’S GOLD.—The Company have declared a dividend of 10 
per cent., payable to all shareholders registered on January 31, 
immediately after receipt of London transfer returns. 

MILL’S DAY DAWN UNITED.—The company state that, following 
upon the dividend of 3d per share declared on the 1! th inst., a further 
dividend of 3d per share, making 6d per share for January, has now 
been declared.

THE CORN TRADE. 


Mark Lane, Friday Evening. 


The trade throughout the week has moved slowly, with but few 
changes in the bearings and tendencies of the primary articles. 
The weather in this country being mild, the growing crops have 
made fairly steady progress, and the accounts from the principal 
agricultural districts, as far as regards the aspect of the growing 
crops in this country, are not unfavourable. The weather has 
become mild over a large section of the Continent, and in Germany 
the reports indicate that the crops have been doing well, but in 
France the grain has not wholly escaped the serious effect of the 
late severe frost. The spot trade has experienced little altera- 
tion. The fluctuations in prices have been extremely small, 
and they have undergone but little variation at any time. 
The cargo trade has been quiet, with small transactions 
from day to day, with little, if any, change in the rates 
obtained. Australian wheats, January - February shipment, 
17,000 quarters Californian, January-February ship- 
ments, sold at 81s 9d, and off-coast at 31s 3d. Oregon, off-coast, 
sold 32s 6d. Hard Manitoba to London, prompt shipment, sold at 
80s, less A rcent, ; also parcels of hard Manitoba to London, first 
half of Fe sold at 30s. River Plate, sailer, February-March, 
changed hands at 28s 9d. Indians quiet; No, 2 Club, Calcutta to 
Hull, April-May, 3's 3d paid. The quantity of wheat and flour 
afloat for the United Kingdom has increased 128,000 qrs, whilst

the week, at steady prices. Beans and peas a slow sale, at late 
rates.

THE IRON AND COAL TRADES. 


The English iron trade, on the whole, does not exhibit any appre- 
ciable alteration. In the Cleveland district, pig-iron prices are 
depressed ; but rates for Scotch makers’ iron show a hardening 
tendency. Finished iron, generally, is in but iimited inquiry ; but 
the tin-plate branch continues to experience an improving demand, 
Steel is only in poor request. Shipbuilders and engineers are but 
irregularly engaged. The coal trade is not very active. 

Our Middlesbro’ correspondent, writing on January 26, says :— 
Our iron market has been very lifeless since the beginning of the 
month. Shipments have been much restricted on account of the 
severe winter on the Continent, which has closed navigation to a 
greater extent than usual. The only outlet is now to Scotland, 
where the high price of warrants forbids the use of pig-iron from 
the store. Home consumption remains poor, especially for hema- 
tite pig-iron. There exists a heavy accumulation of stocks again 
this month. Middlesbro’ pig-iron No. 3 is to-day 35s 6d, and 34s for 
No. 4, sellers, with very little business doing. There are some 
buyers at 34s 6d and 35s for spring. 

Our Cardiff correspondent writes: The shipments of coal during 
the last few days have shown a falling off, and prices are somewhat 
weak. Small coal is offered freely at unusually low prices, the demand 
falling short of the supply. Prices, f.o.b. Cardiff, are as follows : 
best steam, 9s 3d to 10s ; second qualities, 8s 9d to 9s 3d; and smal] 
coal, 2s 6d to 3s 6d. The delegates of the workmen and the Colliery 
Owners’ Association have met, ‘but have failed to agree to terms 
for a new sliding scale. To-day a considerable amount of excite- 
ment has been caused by the announcement of the decision of the 
Colliery Owners’ Association to issue notices to the workmen on the 
Ist of February to terminate the present working arrangement ; 
these notices to expire four weeks from date, that is, at the end of 
February. Notwithstanding the apparent gravity of the situation, 
however, it is likely that wiser counsels will prevail, and that a 
strike, which would be disastrous alike to masters and men, will be 
averted, ' 

Writing as to the foreign iron trade, Jron says :—“ The Austro- 
Hungarian iron market continues quiet, with unaltered quotations. 
Rails and other steel goods are in weak demand, The situation in 
Belgium remains very poor and without hope of an approximate 
improvement. Trade in France is still in a state of expectancy. 
Prices are artificially maintained ; but there is very little business 
moving. The French imports (including temporary 
ofiron and steel (exclusive of scrap).in the year 1892 
199,138 tons, compared with 231,736 tons in 1991; the direct 
exports being 159,765 tons, against 150,251 tons. The German

116 THE ECONOMIST. (January 28, 1893. 


iron market continues dull and weak, but without otherwise mani- 
festing any notable feature. Regarding Spanish iron ore, the Bilbao 
trade continues fairly active at firm rates. The warmer weather 
has adversely affected the continental coal markets. The American 


iron trade shows a slightly improved tendency, and values generally 
are steadier.” 

































































except for imperative wants, manufacturers seem more disposea 4° 
stop their looms than pay present extreme rates. Bolton count® 
weak, and very little business has resulted. For twofolds there is 
not much inquiry, and quotations are barely sustained. In the 
cloth sections sales have been light. India offers more frequent, 
but not often practicable. Shirtings strong, and asa rule 14d per 
piece dearer. China seems to be out of the market for the present. 
Best printers steady, with small transactions. Common makes 
show some irregularity, and buyers have occasionally secured some 
slight concession from regular quotations. Coloured woven goods 
remain without improvement. For heavy cloths there is not more 
than a very moderate inquiry, and full prices difficult to obtain, 
notwithstanding the increased cost of production. Respecting 
to-day’s market nothing better can be said. Eastern business does 
not improve, and for elsewhere demand has been slow and only in 
small quantities, as if for assortment. Quotations unchanged, 
and, in case of American cop yarns, the tendency is against buyers. 
At the conference held this morning between representatives of 
Master Spinners’ and Operatives’ Associations, no arrangement 


was arrived at in connection with the wages dispute, and the meet- 
ing adjourned sine die. 


(1.) Comparative Statement of the Cotton Trade. 





THE COTTON TRADE. 


LIVERPOOL, January 26. 


Cotton is still in retail request, owing to the continuation of the 
labour dispute, but prices generally have been quite steady, and 
quotations show no change. The Bank rate has this day been 
reduced from 3 to 2gper cent. Sea Island has been in moderate 
demand, and prices are in buyers’ favour. American continues in 
very limited request, and only a small business has been done. 
Quotations are unchanged. In Brazilian the business has been 
ouly retail, but quotations are unaltered. Egyptian has been in 
very limited demand; prices are unchanged. Peruvian is in 
moderate request, without change in prices. African is unchanged. 
For East Indian the demand continues very limited, but prices 
show no change. 

“ Futures.”"—The market has been quiet throughout the week, 
and, after some slight fluctuations, the closing values show a decline 
of 4-64d to 5-64d per lb from last Thursday’s Circular rates. The

fibres, such as alpaca, mohair, and English bright wools, in the 
manipulation of which Bradford, twenty.to thirty years ago, practi- 
cally enjoyed a monopoly. The matter is, therefore, one of intense 
interest to the Bradford trade. For the last two years there has 
been a steady growth in the consumption of mohair, but hitherto it 
has been mainly in thick yarns spun from low qualities, and not for 
dress goods. Quite lately there has been a demand for the finer 
yarns, and the consequence is that alpaca, mohair, and lustre 
wools are all quite strong, whereas merinos are barely firm, 
Messrs Jacomb, Son, and Co. write under date January 24 as

market for coarse and ‘‘lustre’”’ grades. Those sold thus far have 
met with very brisk demand at 5 per cent. advance. Cape and 
Natals rule on the average slightly Chou favour. There would 
seem to be available stock enough now for the series to run the 
whole course of ita originally arranged programme, especially 
having regard to the very late arrival of a large proportion of the 
stock, which will necessarily render the earlier catalogues light. 
The firm supply the following statistics : —

THE LEATHER TRADE. 


There has not been much business done in leather during the 
week ; the demand continues for small parcels of goods, for which 
full prices are obtained, but there is little disposition to purchase 
for future requirements. The stocks and supplies of fresh leather 
generally meet the wants of buyers. 








JUTE, FLAX, AND HEMP TRADE. 


Jute is firm, but not active. Entries for export from Calcutta in 
the 21 days of January were 155,000 bales. A firm of shippers who 
have been unable to fulfil their contracts for delivery request claims 
to be made with a view to settlement. Some holders do not sell, 
holding Jute against sales made to arrive. About 16,000 bales 
reported, including first Native marks, January-February shipment, 
at £13 10s for London, RF'D in square, December-January, at £13 5s. 
For Dundee red RB, No. 2, December, £14. Jute goods firm, 
fully maintaining their former position. 

Flax is still advancing on the spot and to arrive. Archangel 
sold, to arrive, at £49, c.f. and i., for lst crown for America. Stocks 
of Flax in Dundee are very low. Yarns are held at prices too high 
to admit of business. 

Manila Hemp more indemand. Fair quality quoted £28 to £28 10s, 
January to March, the communication with Manila being delayed. 
Business includes good marks on the spot at £30 10s to £31. Zebu 
at £30. Last week’s receipts were 12,000 bales, 











COLONIAL AND FOREIGN PRODUCE MARKETS. 
: Mincing Lane, Friday. 
For Report of this Day’s Markets, see ‘‘ Postscript.” 


SUGAR.—The market, unsettled during the greater part of the 
week, is now more steady as t,and the increase in the 
estimate given in Mr, Licht’s report was anticipated. More busi- 
ness was done yesterday, and supplies are soon likely to be available 


for export from Hamburg if the thaw continues. Refiners do nob 
buy to any extent, but speculative prices show 14d recovery from 
the lowest accepted during the week. Few sales have been effected 
in Cane. Jaggery, to arrive, is rather dearer. More inquiry pre- 
vails for srystallised Demerara, several parcels finding buyers or 
private contract, and 3,283 bags in public sale, at 17s to 18s 6d, 
with a few syrups, at 13s 3d to 13s 74d. Refined has not varied in 
price. Pieces have sold for America. The visible supply of sugar 
in Europe exceeds that of last year’s, but the United States’ stock is 
smalier. 


Imports and Deliveries of Sugar into London from commencement of the year to 
January 21, with Stocks remaining at the latter date.

2 THE INVESTOR'S MONTHLY MANUAL.  [Jan. 31, 1993 | Jat 


NOTES UPON INVESTMENTS. 


ARGENTINA AND HER CREDITORS. 

It is difficult to resist the conclusion that Sir John Lubbock, 
in giving the impression, at the general meeting of Argentine 
External Bondholders, that the Government was able, if 
willing, to pay its creditors in_ full, drew rather an 
optimistic picture of the position. No doubt, if the Govern- 
ment could, by exercising the most rigid economy, cut 
its expenses right down to the bone, it might be able to 
meet the creditors in this manner ; but it is quite certain 
that the rigorousness of the retrenchment which’ would be 
required for this would be too much for the Government to 
undertake and carry out; and it is to be feared that to 
encourage the idea that Argentina will economise to 
the extent sufficient to pay the bondholders in full is 
simply to court disappointment. It appears useless 
to expect so much as that; but what we may expect 
is, that the mcney with which the bondholders have supplied 
the country shall not, at any rate, be wasted in lavish 
expenditure. The Argentine Government must show a 
reasonable endeavour to meet the bondholders, and if this 
were done, we feel sure the bondholders would receive its 
proposals in a conciliatory spirit, and endeavour to make the 
settlement as easy as possible. No settlement at all, how- 
ever, would be preferable to one in which the interests of 
the bondholders were made subordinate to the extravagancies 
of the Argentine Government and its officials. If the Govern- 
ment think that the bondholders will be satisfied with 
any mere leavings that may remain after vast sums of 
money have been spent in what under the circumstances can- 
not be characterised as other than wanton extravagance, all 
that we can say is that they are quite mistaken. 





LONDON BANK DIVIDENDS. 


Arthe recent meetings of the London banksthe chairmen have 
with one accord all complained of the unfavourable nature 
of the past half-year as regards banking in the metropolis. 
In the first place, the average rate on money obtained by 
the banks for loans was so iow that they made comparatively 
little profit even on those funds at their disposal upon 
which they pay no interest ; then upon the employment of 
money left with them on deposit, and on which interest has 
to be paid, there was sometimes an actual loss, the rates the 
banks obtained for the use of the money being sometimes 
lower than those they had to pay their depositors ; and 
finally there was, comparatively speaking, very little busi- 
ness at all during the year, either profitable or unprofitable, 
the stagnation on the Stock Exchange being especially 
keenly felt. This state of affairs has resulted in generally 
lower dividends on the half-year’s working, as is shown in 
the following statement :— 
Rate per Cent. per Annnm for 
Second Half-Year of— 
1892. 1891. 1890. 1889. 1888.

Only the London and South-Western Bank, it will be seen, 
has managed to increase its rate of distribution, there being 


a falling off, in some instances considerable, in every other 
case. 








PROVINCIAL BANK DIVIDENDS. 


Tue purely country banks have fared much better than 
those whose business is more or less strictly confined to 
London, for, although they have been capanaaie affected by 
the quietness of commercial business, they have not had to 
contend at the same time, as have the Metropolitan banks, 
with the effects of the falling-off in Stock Exchange specu- 
lation. Moreover, times of financial stagnation are felt 
much more keenly in London, whither the capital not only 
of the country, but to some extent also of the world, has a 
tendency to flow in search of employment, thus causing 
cutting competition. Havin some from these adverse 
influences, the country bank Sividende it will be seen, have 
been well maintained during the past year :—

Out of the above list of forty banks, only seven, it will be 
observed, have distributed a Keres rate of dividend in 1892 
than in 1891; twenty-eight have distributed at a similar 
rate ; and five at a higher. 





PORTUGUESE FINANCIAL EXPEDIENTS. 


FortuNateELy for the market here, it is not very deeply in-

directly very muchaffected by such financial difficultiesas those 
prevailing at the present time in Portugal. Stall the various 
markets of the world are knit together in so close a system), 
that what affects one cannot fail to have some influence more 
or less direct upon the others ; and it is consequently not 
surprising to find that the involved nature of Portugwese 
finance is attracting a good deal of attention here.

words, European shareholders had tocome in person to Johan- 
aesburg with their sharesin their pockets to vote, and the chair- 
manexplained that the object. was to prevent people who had 
a0 concern in the company obtaining proxies and molesting 
thecompany. Mr Lippert opposed this proposal, and suc- 
eded, after a lengthy discussion, in having this clause 
eliminated, and having inserted, that upon depositing the 
res at the London office, certiticates would be issued upon 
which proxies could be made use of. I need scarcely point 
= you the gravity of the new step taken, and it will, no 
fig t, be followed by all the companies in which the same 
clique has the power. The reasons for taking this step are 
lous, and every possible pressure has been brought upon 
Government to alter the Companies Law, soas to permit’ 
_ — of Bearer shares, the Government having quite 
tely yielded to that pressure. It will, of course, be much 
tasier to off-load large amounts of stock, which are 
+. created shortly, under the Bearer share system, 
and it will be easy for the large cliques to make it 
impossible for a combination of small shareholders to 
eeerenlance the weight of the clique in meetings, as 
- re pane will not be able under the Bearer share system 
ad ect proxies, not knowing where to find them. I 
ob do course,aware that the system of Bearer shares largely 
wat ns in Europe, but Iam convinced that it will be attended 
os ‘ mmense drawbacks and dangers inSouth Africa. The 
ead real advantages are those to speculators, viz., the easier 
A guar a from one to another and the saving of clerical 
oan an no other advantages could be elicited from those 
athered this departure. It is true that it is optional 
or anyone to take Bearer shares or nominative shares, but 
€ ends which the parties have in view are such that, they 


will fi ithe market with Bearer shares, and the difficulties 
ed in the way of getting Bearer shares exchanged 
we o¢ nominative shares are such that very few 
£9 to the expense, trouble, and loss of time. One of the 


= will be this, that European shareholders who wish to 
etic 7 rer shares, have to deposit them in the London

€posit them for four days only. In the one instance the 
dis majority of shareholders in Europe is deprived of the 
posal of their shares for two months, while those in South 
fica only for a short period. You can easily see how this

The reports that have been issued are analysed in theusual 
columns, and show that as a general rule there was an in- 
crease in gross revenue accompanied by an increase, of less 
amount, in working expenses, resulting in a slight augment- 
ation of net receipts. Fixed charges, Rain havein most 
cases increased and thus some diminution of the rates of 
dividend was brought about. The results of the Sheffield 
half-year were disappointing, but, on the other hand, those 
of another Watkin line, the Metropolitan, were very satis- 
factory, in spite of the bitter complaints in the report as to 
the competition of the comparatively lightly taxed omnibus 
companies. The reports of the holiday lines mostly com- 
plain of the effects of the cholera epidemic on the Continent, 
and the heavy lines were atlected by the quiet condition of 
business and by the bad harvest. 








FINANCIAL KECORD OF THE MONTH. 


Business in the Stock Markets has been by no means active 
during the month, though, aided by the extreme ease of 
money, there have been one or two speculative spurts. 
At the opening of the markets after the holiday matters 
remained dull, the investment demand being almost entirely 
devoted to Home Government stocks, the first railway 
dividend, that of the Manchester and Shettield Company, 
disappointing general expectation. The ‘subsequent 
announcements have been more satisfactory, so that the 
quotations of Home Railway stocks have been fairly well 
sustained. American Railroad bonds and shares became 
buoyant for atime, and many of the operators who had 
recently gone into other departments, again found sufficient 
attraction to induce them to return. Towards the close of 
the month, however, the London market has at times lacked 
support from Wall Street, and possessing very littie 
inherent strength, has been irregular. Canadian rail- 
way issues have been moderately strong. In the 
Foreign department, the unfolding of the Panama 
scandals, and the Egyptian incident, for a time 
adversely affected prices ; but the Paris Bourse has gradu- 
ally gained strength, in consequence of the knowledge that 
a large amount of weak selling for the fall has taken place 
in French Rentes and in some of the International issues,

1 per cent. Very few bills have been in the market, and 
the discount rate has varied but little from about 1} per 
cent. for three months’ fine paper. Early in the month 
the discount houses and bill brokers reduced their 
allowances on deposits to 1 and 1} per cent. for call 
and notice money respectively, and after the change in the 
Bank rate there was a further reduction to and 1 per cent. 
respectively, whilst the joint-stock banks reduced their 
deposit rates from 1} to 1 per cent. The banks have 
been considering whether they shall not in the future 
fix their rates independently of the Bank rate. For some 
time gold purchases by the Bank of France were sus- 
pended owing to the fact that the note circulation 
iad nearly attained its legal maximum of £140,000,000. 
Both branches of the Legislature, however, have readily 
assented to the passing of a Bill increasing the limit of the 
note issue to £160,000,000, which is now the legal maximum. 
The rate of the Imperial Bank of Germany has been reduced 
from 4 per cent. to 3 per cent. The most uncertain element 
in the position is the attitude of the United States Govern- 
ment with regard to the silver question. There is a very 
strong feeling in favour of the repeal of the Sherman Act, 
but the Silver party is still a powerful one, and it is not to 
be expected that the obligatory purchases of 4,500,000 ozs of 
the metal each month will be given up without a struggle, 
An alteration in the currency policy of the United States 
might very probably be followed by disturbance here, and in 
view of the fact that Austria-Hungary will require to take 
gold for the carrying out of her currency reforms, there is 
every reason to hope that no effort will be wanting to keep 
the Bank reserve at a more than usually ample figure. 


Consols, &c.—There was a strong demand for Home 
Government Funds early in the month, and in consequence, 
quotations for a time exhibited an upward tendency. The 
gold withdrawals for export, however, interposed a check to 
the advance ; but there aa never been anything approach- 
ing to weakness, and quite recently prices lew again 
shown considerable strength. India sterling issues have 
been well maintained; but Rupee paper has given way 
slightly. The silver difficulty is as pronounced as ever, and 
with every fluctuation in the market price of the metal Rupee 
paper varies, Colonial Government bonds have been somewhat 
out offavour, fears being entertained that Victoria will follow 
the example ot Queensland—which has issued a 3} per cent. 
loan at a minimum price of 88 per cent.—in appealing to the 
London money market. The Mauritius 3 per cent. loan, 
with a Government guarantee, was a conspicuous success, 
There has been a fairly good demand for Home Corporation 
stocks; but not of such a kind as to affect quotations 
materially. Speaking generally, it may be said that the 
great majority of securities of the highest class have been 
in strong request during the month ; and this is not surpris- 
ing in view of the slow growth of returning confidence, and 
the very small rates allowed upon deposits by the banks 
and discount houses. 


Home Railways.—For the most part Home railway stocks 
have moved upwards, for in the majority of cases the divi- 
dend announcements have been in excess of the market 
anticipations. It is true that the Sheffield Company led off 
badly, with 3 per cent. on the ordinary stock, against 4 per 
cent. a year ago; but the effect of this announcement was 
neutralised by the Brighton dividend, giving “ Berthas ” 
7 per cent, and leaving an amount he carried forward 
equal to fully another 4 per cent. The price of Brighton 
“ A’s” moved up rapidly from a little over 147 to 1544, but 
the statements by Mr Laing at the meeting were received 
unfavourably in the market, and caused some relapse. 
Brighton “ A’s” were in short supply at the last gettle- 
ment, and the “ bears” had to pay a small fine for the pri 
vilege of continuing their operations for the fall. The deci- 
sion of the board to discontinue the publication of daily 
traflics is undoubtedly a wise one, for the statements were 
serviceable only to speculative cliques. The South-Eastern 
dividend was an exceedingly poor one, but the quotation of 
the “A” stock has been kept up. The other Watkin divi- 
dend, the Metropolitan, took the market by surprise; it 
was so much better than had been anticipated. The 
heavy lines have been well supported, though goods 
traffic receipts—in spite of the ere against the rates— 
have shown a decline. The South-Western dividend was 
fully up to the general estimates, and the stock has been in 
strong request. One of the most conspicuous features of 
the month has been the strength displayed by the Scotch 
stocks, which have been largely bought by Glasgow and 
Edinburgh speculators, who apparently believe that the 
dividends will compare very favourably with those 
announced a year ago. Great Easterns have also had a 
firm tendency, on prospective merits mainly, for at present 
the yield on the stock is but little over 2h per cent. It is 
worthy of note that the Great Eastern Company’s receipts 
for the carriage of coal have shown a very satisfactory

expansion, and much better returns are looked for when th 
connection with the Lancashire and East Coast Railway 
gives the Great Eastern direct access to the Derbyshire 
colliery districts. 


Foreign Government Securities. There hay 
considerable fluctuations in the prices of Foland 
ment bonds. Early in the month the tendency was dis- 
tinctly weak, in sympathy with the state of affairs on the 
Paris Bourse, where the revelations in connection with the 
Panama Canal Company had brought about a very uneasy 
feeling. International stocks fell away nearly all round, 
Greek bonds being no exception, although the belief seems 
to be entertained that Mr Law’s report on the position of the 
finances of the Hellenic Government will be of a reassurin 
character. Nosoonerhad the Paris Bourse begun to rightitse 
than increased uneasiness began tobe felt regardin a upshot. 
of the Egyptian difticulty. The youthful Khedive, Abbas 
Pasha, had appointed as Premier Fakhri Pasha, a politician 
who was notoriously opposed to reforms in general, and to 
the British ae ¢ i in particular. By the prompt inter- 
position of Lord Cromer, however, matters were placed upor 
a more satisfactory footing, and despite the somewhat 
alarmist utterances in the continental Press, it is generally 
believed that the worst effects of the incident have been 
experienced. In Paris, at all events, a firmer tone has been 
established, and the recent operators for the fall have 
been buying back in several directions. Meanwhile, so far 
as London is concerned, the International securities affected 
by the disturbance at Paris are left almost entirely to the 
arbitrage dealers. At one time Argentine bonds and 
cedulas moved upwards; but the improvement was only 
short lived, and on balance quotations are lower than they 
were a month ago. The gold premium at Buenos Ayres, after 
remaining for some days at about 194 per cent., advanced 
rapidly to 215 per cent., and this fact, coupled with adverse 
political rumours and statements contemplating the suspen- 
sion of the issue of funding bonds, sutticed to stop-the specu- 
lation for the rise. At the meeting of bondholders on 
Thursday last a Committee was appointed to act in their 
interest ; but the statement made by Sir John Lubbock on 
that occasion were of too sanguine a nature to command 
general confidence. Uruguayan, Mexican, and other South 
and Central American bonds have shown some animation 
and have risen generally. The improvement in the Brazilian 
exchange has not, however, been accompanied by any advance 
in the price of the bonds. 


American Railroads.—For the first week or so of the new 
year the American railroad market was very dull and 
weak, fears being entertained that the gold efflux would 
continue. Later on, however, Wall Street operators for the 
rise made strenuous efforts to restore vitality to the market, 
and for that purpose they bought freely on both sides of the 
Atlantic, and the efforts were successful foy atime. The 
best points have not been maintained ; but om balance the 
“bulls” have prospered. Louisville and Nashville shares 
have been especially strong, for though the dividend was 
2dols. only as against 24 dols. for the corresponding half- 
year, the accounts showed that the net earnings were * ~ 
than for the second half of 1891, despite the depression int 4 
cotton and iron industries of the Southern States. 3 
waukees, Denver Prefs., Atchisons, Illinois Centrals, . 
Northern Pacific Prefs. have been largely bong 7 
operators for the rise. Philadelphia and Reading shares have 
fluctuated considerably, and have lost favour ——- 
investors. The full dividends were declared on the three 
classes of Income bonds, somewhat contrary to oer 
expectation ; but some of the money required tor the ~ 
butions had to be borrowed, and the arrangements en “ 
into for financing the Coal and lron Companyare nO eee 
with favour, while the great anthracite coal com as 
promises to meet with many difliculties. Towards the Sook 
of the month prices have moved irregularly, and the ou 
is quite uncertain. 


Miscellaneous. — Amongst Foreign and Colonial ¥4 
ways, Grand Trunk of Canada stocks have im ae 
sympathy with American railroads, though : * 
returns have been unsatisfactory, owing partly we hy 
lence of snowdrifts. Canadian Pacific shares -v - 
moderately strong, though the dealings in them Coos) 
restricted. Late in the month Mexican (Vera (rut)

NOTICES AND REPORTS. 


BRITISH, COLONIAL, AND FOREIGN RAILWAYS. 


BELFAST AND NORTHERN COUNTIES. —The directors recommend 
a dividend on the ordinary stock at the rate of 54 per cent. per 
annum for the half-year ended December 31 last, carrying forward 
a balance of about £5,000 to next half-year’s accounts. 

CITY AND SOUTH LONDON.—The report for the half-year ended 
December 31st states that the receipts from all sources amounted 
to £22,652, and the cost of working to £15,389. Inclusive of the 
balance brought forward the net revenue account shows an aggre- 
gate total of £8,304. After making provision for debenture and 
debenture stock interest, a balance remains available for dividend 
of £4,045. The directors recommend the full dividend of 5 per 
cent. per annum on the preference shares, and a dividend at the 
rate of § per cent. per annum on the consolidated ordinary stock, 
leaving £822 to be carried forward. The number of passengers 
conveyed, exclusive of season ticket holders, was 3,217,602, showing: 
an increase of 468,547. Difficulties with the local autherities 
have, it is stated, delayed the the commencement of the much 
needed siding accommodation at Stockwell station, forming part of 
the Clapham extension line, but it is hoped that these works will 
very shortly be started. The conversion of the terminal debentures 
into eithet 4 per cent. perpetual debenture stock or 5 per cent. per- 
petual preference shares is progressing satisfactorily, and will result 
in a considerable saving of interest to the company. A resolution 
for the conversion into consolidated ordinary stock of the remaining 
3,000 ordinary shares already issued will be submitted to the 
special meeting to be held at the conclusion of the half-yearly 
meeting. 

CORK, BANDON, AND SOUTH COAST.—The directors recommend a 
dividend on the ordinary stock at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum 
for the half-year ended December 31, carrying £600 to locomotive 
renewals and £1,776 to next account. 


CORK, BLACKROCK, AND PASSAGE.—A dividend at the rate of 2 per 
cent. per annum for the half-year has been declared on the ordinary 
shares. 

EAST LONDON. —The company in their report for the half-year 
ended December 31, state that the goods traffic, as settled by the 
Railway Clearing-house, for the six months ended October 31, 
amounted to £1,891, showing a decrease of £129, and the coaching 
traffic to £22,913, an increase of £376. The question of the lessees’ 
division of responsibility under the lease having been referred. to 
Mr. Charles Scotter, the standing arbitrator under the East London 
Railway Act, 1882, was heard by him on the 22nd of Noveraber 
last. By his award, dated December 12th, it is provided that the 
lessees shall contribute towards any deficiency in fixed proportions 
The distinctive quality of this award, has, it is stated, been con- 
tended for by the directors from the time when the difference origin- 
ated, and it may be recorded that, as one of its first effects, through 
bookings to the Lendon and Brighton Company’s stations south of 
Croydon (withdrawn from January, 1886) have already been resumed. 
The arbitrator stated in his award that it had been made clear to 
him that it would be to the advantage of all the lessee companies, 
as well as of the Kast London Company, that the lessee companies 
should do their best to pass traffic over the East London Railway, 
and that all obstacles in the way of traffic so going should be re- 
moved or avoided, and that no company should be penalized by way 
of rebate out of their own receipts for passing traflic over the Hast 
London. 


GREAT EASTERN.—The accounts for the past half-year show an 
increase in gross revenue of £53,766, and an addition to expendi- 
ture of £51,483. The continental earnings have been materially. 
affected by the cholera epidemic, The passenger traffic from Ham- 
burg has been discontinued for many months, and the Rotterdam 
and Antwerp passenger traffic shows a serious decline, and has only 
lately resumed its usual proportions. The working expenses have 
again increased in various departments ; and the amounts for com- 
pensation for personal injary show a large addition to the usual 
charges under that head, in consequence of past accidents, The 
condition of the districts served by the railway has been preju- 
dicially affected by the bad harvest of 1892, and the low prices of 

roduce. The new rates now charged have, in some instances, 
een severely criticised ; but the directors, in conjunction with other 
railway companies, are desirious of meeting the traders as far as 
they can. a sail ‘ : 

HULL ARNSLEY.—The accounts for the pas' -year do no 

rmit prety payment of a dividend on the ordinary stock, but a 
cohen of £5,276 is carried forward, At the corresponding period 
last year a distribution at the rate of % per cent. per annum was 
made, and £2950 was ee a Sospete 

CASHIRE AND YORKSHIRE.—The directors recom 
dividend for the past half-year at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, 
carrying forward about £21,000. 

LONDON AND BLACKWALL.—The report for the half-year ending 
December $1 recommends a dividend at the usual rate of £4 10s per 
cent. per annum, payable on February 8. The directors eee 
the adoption of the Forged Transfers Acts, and to charge : °

The report states that the traffic was good during the first two 
months of the half-year, but has fallen off since August. This is 
potty owing to the loss of about £10,000 in continental and steam- 

oat traffic, attributable to the cholera, and partly to the weather, 
which, after being fine during the spring and summer holidays, 
changed intoa wet and stormy autumn and winter. But some 
allowance must also probably be made for the depression of trade, 
and for the severe agricultural distress, aggravated by a disastrous 
harvest. The directors recommend the following dividends, viz.: 
—£4 12s 6d per cent. for the half-year on the undivided ordinary 
stock (making 64 per cent. for the whole year), £3 per cent. for the 
half-year on the preferred ordinary stock (making 6 per cenv. for 
the whole year), £7 per cent. for the whole year on the deferred 
ordinary stock, and 10s per cent. for the whole year on contingent 
rights, leaving a balance of £22,646 to be carried forward to next 
half-year. It is intended to discontinue the publication of the daily 
eturns of traffic, 

LONDON AND SOUTH-WESTERN.—The company recommend a divi- 
dend for the half-year ended December 31, 1892, at the rate of 7? per 
cent. per annum on the original ordinary stock, the full dividend at 
the rate of 4 percent. perannum for the half-year on the preferred con- 
verted ordinary stock, and 2 per cent, for the whole year on the de- 
ferred converted ordinary stock, The dividend of 7? per cent, on 
the ordinary stock is the same as that paid for the corresponding 
period of 1891, andthe balance of net revenue carried forward is 
£22,462, as compared with £17,192. 

LONDON, TILBURY, AND SOUTHEND.—The directors recommend a 
dividend on the ordinary stock for the past half-year of 54 per cent, 
per annum, carrying forward about £700. The dividend for the 
corresponding period was at the rate of 54 per cent. per annum, 
witha balance of £1,610, 

LONDON, TILBURY, AND SOUTHEND.—The report states that the 
§ross receipts for the half-year ending December 31 last amount to 
£143,398, against £136,377; the gross expenses to £74,152, against 
£66,424; and the net result is a profit balance of £69,246, against 
£69,953 for the corresponding half-year of 1891. After providing for 
rent and for interest on debenture stock, the balance of net revenue 
1s £53,208. This sum enables the directors, after providing for 
preferential charges, to recommend a dividend on the ordinary stock 
for the past half-year at the rate of £5 5s per cent. per annum, 
leaving a balance of £713 to be carried forward. The dividend for 
the corresponding period of 1891 was at the rate of £5 10s per cent. 
per annum, and a balance of £1,610 was carried over. In conse- 
quence of the action of the Great Eastern Railway Company in 
abolishing second-class carriages on their railway, the board have 
found it necessary to follow a similar course, and the operation will 
be completed on the whole system on March 31 next. The directors 
recommend the adoption of the Forged Transfers Act, and have 
also decided not to make any charge.

The report states that considerable loss has been sustained by the 
suspension of work owing to the dispute in the cotton trade and a 


strike at the iron worksin Lincolnshire. The cholera epidemic in, 


Europe, particularly in Hamburg, and a severe competition in the 


Rotterdam and Antwerp trades, inaugurated. by a line of steamers 


between Flushing and Hull, caused a considerable falling off in the 
company’s Continental traffic. The directors much regret that, in 
consequence of the unusually wet summer and autumn, the com- 
pletion of the new line between Staveley and Annesley _ been 
delayed longer than was anticipated, and consequently the large 
outlay incurred has remained practically unproductive during the. 
whole of the half-year, which’ explains the diminution in the divi- 
dend ‘on the’ ordinary stock. The Bill for the London extension

The report states that the competition between the rival omnibus 
companies, at fares which it is impossible for the heavily-taxed 
underground railways to compete with, has seriously affected the 
company’s local receipts. The directors hope that thé disastrous 
effect upon the omnibus companies themselves will lead to a wiser 
policy. The directors further state that the agreement for the 
interchange of trains on the inner circle, which expired in June 
Jast, has not been renewed, though the District Company have been 
frequently asked to formulate proposals. The present arrangements 
are being continued until June next, pending negotiations, They 
recommend a dividend for the half-year at the rate of 34 per cent. 
per annum on the ordinary stock, and the usual 2} per cent. for 
the half-year on surplus lands stock, and that £9,807 be carried 
forward. The board also recommend the adoption of the Forged

LONDON AND ST KATHARINE DOCK.—The report states that the 
proportion of the net revenue of the combined companies accruing to 
the East and West India Dock Company will be sufficient to pay 
not only the 2 per cent. dividend on the debenture stock for the 
half-year, and the 2 per cent. on the deferred debenture stock, but 
to give a further 4 per cent. towards clearing off the arrears of 
interest due on that deferred debenture stock. ‘ This will leave only 
about as much again of arrears to pay off, after which the ordinary 
stock will again have a chance of receiving some dividend— 
assuming, i.¢., that the prosperity of the Port of London continues, 
which is not improbable.”

TRUSTEES, EXECUTORS, AND SECURITIES.—The directors in their 
report for the past twelve months, say :—‘* The income derived from 
pe emg and executorships, and from the letting of safes, strong 
rooms, and halls for public meetings has been maintained, but the 
continued commercial depression has deprived the directors of the 
opportunities of undertaking the lucrative financial business from 
which so large a proportion of the corporation’s profits have hitherto 
been derived. In accordance with the intimation given at the last 
general meeting the directors, in May last, succeeded in placing 
£500,000 First Mortgage Four per Cent. debentures. The share- 
holders are awareof the numerous rumours affectihg the corpor- 
ation’s financial position, which were current at the end of last year. 
The directors consider that the best reply to such reports is the 
publication of a balance-sheet in which the fullest provision is 


‘MONTHLY MANUAL. — [Jan. 31, 1993 


made not only for losses ascertained, but also for further 
losses, and in order to do this effectually they have decided t 
write off £200,000 from the reserve fund, and to carry a ' 
sum of £150,000 to a suspense account to meet any 
additional depreciation as well as the expenses of the d 
issue. In taking these precautionary measures they feel sure that ” 
they will have the approval of the shareholders. At the same time 
they beg the shareholders not to regard this amount as 

lost.” The revenue account, after discharging all expenses of 
management and providing for debenture interest, showsa net 

of £31,637, to which the directors have added the balance undivided 
at December 31, 1891, including the amount of £13,000 set aside to 
a special reserve fund for the equalisation of dividends. Out of 
the total sum thus available—viz., £45,690—the directors recom. 
mend a further dividend of 33 per cent. on the ordinary 
making a total dividend of 7 per cent. for the year, and leaving 
£3,710 to be carried forward. In these circumstances, the directors 
regret that they are at present unable to make any distribution to 
the holders of the founders’ shares. At the same time the directors 
point out that they have “not included in the accounts of the 
year profits of about £56,000, which have accrued during that 
period, but which, owing to certain formalities, have not yet been 
received.” 

_ UNION DISCOUNT.—The accounts show a gross profit of £99,359, 
including the balance brought forward from last half-year, and after 
making provision for bad and doubtful debts, allowing rebate of 
interest, amounting to £37,383 on bills not yet due, and deducting 
current expenses, there remains a balance of £50,351. Out of this 
sum the directors propose to place £2,500 to provident reserve fund, 
to pay a dividend at the rate of 9 per cent. per annum for the six 
months, free of income tax, and to carry the balance, £19,691, over 
toe nw account.

dividend warrants, say that the position of the company, as shown 
by the audit to September 30 last, gives them great satisfaction, 
The sales have increased by 18,000 barrels over the corresponding 
period of last year, and the profits have been benefited by this in- 
crease and by the results of careful management, so that, after 
paying the present dividend, a considerably larger amount of un- 
divided profits remains in hand than after any previous interim 
distribution. The returns from the end of the half-year to Novem- 
ber 30 show continued excellent results.
